# Design Files

Drop your HTML mockup files here. These are your design references — the raw HTML/CSS that represents what the final site should look like.

## How to use

1. Place your HTML design file in this folder (e.g., `homepage.html`, `about.html`)
2. Open a Claude Code conversation in the project root
3. Say: **"Build the homepage from `design/homepage.html`"**

Claude will read the design file, extract the content and styling, and build it into the Vite + Tailwind project structure (`index.html` + `src/style.css` + `src/main.js`).

## Reference example

- `homepage-amn.html` — A complete single-page landing page (Authority Media Network) built with this template. Use it as a reference for structure, Tailwind patterns, and component design.
