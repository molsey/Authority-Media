Sean shares how his passion for education, trust, and innovation led to the creation of a platform that’s reshaping how consumers connect with home-focused content. They discuss the power of content ownership, the importance of trust in building loyal audiences, and what businesses need to know before stepping into the streaming space. Sean also breaks down how Your Home TV is creating new opportunities for collaboration and growth in the digital media world.",93YGkkNuu,,"<h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Sean Stockell: Authority via Streaming Media</strong></h2><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast, George Wright III here.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Today, I’m excited to dive into a topic we haven’t explored before: connected TV and streaming. As many of you know, I’ve been a strong advocate for building authority and visibility, and today’s guest is an incredible example of just that.</strong></p><p id="""">Sean Stockell, our guest today, is the CEO of <em id="""">Your Home Digital</em>, the founder and executive producer of <em id="""">Your Home TV</em>, and the publisher of <em id="""">Your Home, One Source</em>. Partnered with Cathy Ireland Worldwide, Sean leads digital media and marketing strategies for numerous top-tier brands and influencers. Just this year alone, Sean’s platforms have achieved over 6.3 million new mobile viewers and amassed 53 million total views.</p><p id="""">Let’s jump right in and get to know Sean’s incredible journey.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You didn’t start in the digital media space—you came from banking. Tell us a bit about your background. How did it all begin?</strong></p><p id="""">I grew up in the Midwest, in St. Louis County, Missouri. I got my start in the savings and loan industry after working with my father at his real estate company while attending community college. I first earned my real estate license, followed by my broker’s license, before transitioning to the savings and loan sector.</p><p id="""">That was in 1984—showing my age a bit here—and I spent the next 32 years in mortgage banking, wholesale mortgage banking, and community banking. I began my career in the Midwest and eventually relocated to Tampa, Florida, 27 years ago.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Moving from banking to digital media is quite a leap. What prompted that transition? Was it a forced pivot or a new opportunity you identified?</strong></p><p id="""">Great question! Change is inevitable in every industry. The rise of the internet in the late ’90s, and by the year 2000, made it clear that no matter your field, being active online was essential to stay relevant.</p><p id="""">I’ve always been someone who listens, observes, and learns. While at South Trust Bank and later Bay Cities Bank in Tampa, I raised my hand to help develop websites and online interactions for our customers. That’s when I discovered how much I loved the creativity and strategic thinking that came with the tech side of things.</p><p id="""">For instance, at the last bank I worked at, I built their lending division and developed their website. By the time we sold the bank seven years later, 80% of our mortgage business came through the website I helped create. That was a turning point for me—I realized the potential and excitement of working in digital.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Did you have any tech experience before diving into digital media? Or did you learn as you went?</strong></p><p id="""">I actually had some early experience. Back in 1993, while on vacation in Virginia, an old friend called me with an idea: to create a system like TurboTax, but for navigating the home mortgage process.</p><p id="""">I thought it was a fantastic idea, so we spent 1994 and 1995 working on it as a side hustle. We called it <em id="""">Loan Source</em>, and it was built for floppy disks—this was well before the internet was mainstream! The product guided users through mortgage terminology and qualification processes.</p><p id="""">This experience taught me the basics of tech development, and while it wasn’t directly connected to what I do today, it laid the foundation for understanding digital tools.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Transitioning to the Digital and Streaming Space</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What was the transition like from banking to digital and, eventually, the streaming space?</strong></p><p id="""">It wasn’t an easy journey. Around 2008, the housing crisis hit, and the industry was in turmoil. Thankfully, I had already started building the foundation for <em id="""">Your Home, One Source</em> as a side project.</p><p id="""">At the same time, I was still working full-time at a community bank, building their residential lending division. This dual approach—working full-time while developing my platform in the evenings—was similar to what I had done with <em id="""">Loan Source</em> a decade earlier.</p><p id="""">What really made a difference, though, was surrounding myself with people smarter than me. I put together an outstanding board of advisors, including our chairman, David McCain, who was previously the Chief Legal Officer at Lennar Corporation, the largest publicly traded homebuilder at the time. Building the right leadership team was crucial to our success.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What strategy did you use to attract such a strong leadership team? Many people have innovative ideas but struggle to bring in the right people.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s a great question. For me, it came down to presenting a clear vision. I’ve always been a writer, so I created concise business development plans and turned them into engaging presentations.</p><p id="""">These presentations were highly illustrated with great graphics, which became a hallmark of <em id="""">Your Home, One Source</em>. Whether we were talking about interior design or homebuilding, we ensured the visuals were captivating.</p><p id="""">The presentations were kept short—about 10 slides—because you don’t want to overwhelm people. Then, I set up in-person meetings, often over lunch, to explain my concepts. Within 30 minutes to an hour, I could share my vision and invite people to join me.</p><p id="""">I always approached these meetings as opportunities for collaboration. Smart executives know they don’t have all the answers, so I sought feedback and invited them to team up with me. Together, we figured things out.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How did this strategy evolve into what we now know as <em id="""">Your Home, One Source</em>?</strong></p><p id="""">The turning point came when the bank I was working for sold, creating a cash event for me. With four growing children, I told my wife, “I’m going to take this nest egg and dive full-time into the digital media space.” That decision marked the end of my banking career in September 2015.</p><p id="""">By January 1, 2016, we officially launched <em id="""">Your Home Digital</em> and its platform, <em id="""">Your Home, One Source</em>. Over the years, we gradually expanded our leadership team, bringing in experts from various industries. For example, one of our early advisors was a former general manager of Home Shopping Network.</p><p id="""">We decided to focus on education. The home industry at the time was highly fragmented—there was no one-stop-shop for homeowners to find resources. If you wanted a mortgage, you’d go to LendingTree; if you wanted to buy a home, it was Realtor.com.</p><p id="""">We aimed to centralize all these resources, creating an Amazon or Walmart-style platform for the home industry. Over the first five years, we partnered with over 40 brands, including Home Advisor, Lowe’s, Home Depot, and BobVila.com.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Education isn’t always the obvious path for a business. What made you choose it?</strong></p><p id="""">Great question. Two main reasons influenced this decision:</p><p id="""">First, the housing crisis taught me that a lack of education can lead to poor decisions. If more people had been properly informed, perhaps the financial collapse wouldn’t have been as devastating.</p><p id="""">Second, I learned during my banking career that trust and service are key. People do business with trusted advisors who offer exceptional customer service. By educating consumers, we positioned ourselves as trusted advisors while also providing unmatched value.</p><p id="""">In the first five years, we built a massive platform with 900 pages of content, nearly 400 articles, and tools like checklists and calculators. We even had 22,000 outbound links to resources like Realtor.com, FEMA, and the National Association of Realtors.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Pivoting to Streaming</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">How did <em id="""">Your Home, One Source</em> lead to the creation of <em id="""">Your Home TV</em>?</strong></p><p id="""">The transition to streaming started early on. In 2016, during our first year in business, I purchased the domain <em id="""">Your Home TV</em>. Initially, we partnered with a company called Content Puppy to create a library of short-run educational videos for the home industry.</p><p id="""">We produced over 200 videos for brands like Anderson Windows and focused on visually engaging, story-driven content. This set the stage for more video production, including commercials for home industry brands.</p><p id="""">About three and a half years ago, we began placing these commercials on streaming platforms like YouTube and HGTV. That’s when our CMO pointed out that streaming was growing at 30% year-over-year, with projections for continued growth.</p><p id="""">After a year of research and planning, we launched <em id="""">Your Home TV</em> in November 2022 as an independent OTT (over-the-top) streaming platform. While we’re on Roku in 20 countries, most of our viewers access us through mobile devices in over 80 countries.</p><p id="""">For those unfamiliar, <em id="""">Your Home TV</em> is a free global streaming network offering live streams and video-on-demand content. It’s family-friendly and covers a wide range of topics, including home trends, real estate, finance, and more.</p><p id="""">Our platform stands out because of its focus on short-run programming. While platforms like Netflix and Disney+ focus on movies, we deliver shorter content—ranging from 3-minute videos to 60-minute shows, with an average length of 17-20 minutes.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Future of Streaming</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Where do you see streaming heading in the next 3-5 years?</strong></p><p id="""">Streaming will continue to evolve. While cord-cutting has been a major trend, people will still pay for subscriptions alongside free options. It’s similar to how newspapers and print media adapted to the internet—they didn’t disappear but found a new equilibrium.</p><p id="""">We believe in focusing on mobile streaming because that’s where most viewers are. Platforms like YouTube, with 2.7 billion users, far outpace traditional connected TV audiences. The future lies in creating accessible, engaging content for mobile devices.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What advice would you give to producers, creators, or businesses considering streaming?</strong></p><p id="""">First and foremost, control and own your content. Don’t enter into licensing agreements that transfer control to another party. These arrangements often promise monetization but don’t always deliver, and you may struggle to regain control of your content later.</p><p id="""">Flexibility is also critical. Work with a company that allows you to maintain control over your production schedule. Whether you want to release one show per month or one per week, the timing should be up to you.</p><p id="""">Many larger networks impose rigid requirements, such as specific time formats or strict production standards. We encourage creators to prioritize authentic storytelling, which resonates more with audiences on mobile platforms.</p><p id="""">It’s also worth noting that YouTube is the largest streaming platform, with 2.7 billion users, compared to 450 million households across all major connected TV networks combined. Mobile streaming reaches an even larger global audience—3.7 billion people.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The takeaway?</strong> Focus on mobile-friendly content, as it offers the widest reach and aligns with how viewers consume media today.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve mentioned collaboration as a key component of <em id="""">Your Home TV</em>. Can you elaborate?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Streaming platforms often have high barriers to entry—financially and logistically. Building your own independent streaming service can cost millions of dollars and take years to develop, with no guarantee of success.</p><p id="""">That’s why we designed <em id="""">Your Home TV</em> as a collaborative platform. We act as a technology host, providing the infrastructure and even marketing services for influencers, brands, and filmmakers.</p><p id="""">By partnering with us, creators can focus on what they do best—producing content—while we handle the technology and distribution. It’s a turnkey solution that lowers costs and accelerates time to market.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Building Trust and Authority</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why is trust so important in the streaming and digital space?</strong></p><p id="""">Trust is everything. People do business with brands they trust and return to those that provide exceptional service. That’s why we’ve always emphasized education and transparency.</p><p id="""">By offering free, hassle-free access to resources and content, we remove barriers that might otherwise deter users. Our partnerships with respected brands and institutions further reinforce our credibility.</p><p id="""">When you’re seen as a trusted advisor, your audience stays loyal, which in turn attracts new partners and opportunities.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s next for <em id="""">Your Home TV</em>?</strong></p><p id="""">We’re focused on expanding our reach and refining our content strategy. Short-run programming remains our core, as it aligns with modern viewing habits. Whether it’s a 3-minute segment or a 20-minute episode, the goal is to deliver value quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="""">Streaming isn’t just about entertainment; it’s about creating relationships and building communities. By continuing to prioritize education, trust, and collaboration, we aim to become the go-to resource for home industry topics worldwide.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What parting advice would you give to someone completely new to streaming?</strong></p><p id="""">Start by creating a clear vision for your content. Focus on storytelling and delivering value to your audience. Partner with platforms or companies that align with your goals and make the process simple.</p><p id="""">Remember, control your content, choose flexible partners, and focus on mobile-friendly formats. Streaming offers incredible opportunities, but success comes from authenticity and consistency.</p><p id="""">For those interested in exploring <em id="""">Your Home TV</em>, simply type “Your Home TV” into your browser.

I’m especially excited today to introduce a new partner of the Evolution Group and <em id="""">The Daily Mastermind</em>, as well as an incredible individual.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me take a moment to introduce today’s guest before we dive in.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Tom Hazard is the co-owner of Podetize, a groundbreaking company in the podcasting world. He’s not just a strategist for speakers, authors, and experts but also an inventor with an impressive track record. Over the years, Tom has worked with sports stars, entrepreneurs, influencers, and other high-profile clients, helping them amplify their reach through podcasting, broadcasting, and video casting.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But there’s more. Tom holds around 40 U.S. patents, having innovated for over 30 years. His latest creation, Podetize, has completely reinvented the podcast hosting, advertising, and branding space.

He co-hosts multiple shows and starts a new podcast every year, putting himself in the shoes of his clients. His work has been featured in <em id="""">Harvard Business Review, Forbes, Wired, Authority Magazine,</em> and many other notable publications. He’s also appeared as a guest on countless podcasts, sharing his expertise.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Tom’s achievements are vast—he’s responsible for over $2 billion in products and innovations worldwide.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s my absolute pleasure to welcome Tom Hazard to <em id="""">The Daily Mastermind</em>. How are you doing, Tom?</strong></p><p id="""">I’m doing great, George. Thanks so much for having me on <em id="""">The Daily Mastermind</em>.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m thrilled to have you here. Many of our listeners might not know this, but we’ve been working together on some in-depth strategies recently. With so much focus on authority marketing, I’ve found that podcasting consistently rises to the top as one of the most effective tools available. Before we dig into specific strategies, could you share a bit about your journey and what led you to podcasting?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Tom’s Journey into Podcasting</strong></h3><p id="""">That’s a great question, and one I don’t get asked often! My educational background might surprise you—I actually studied art. I went to the Rhode Island School of Design, where I focused on industrial design. By nature, I’m a designer, inventor, and creative thinker.</p><p id="""">I spent over 20 years working in consumer product industries. My business partner, Tracy, and I designed products you’ve probably bought at places like Costco, Staples, or Target. Although you wouldn’t know we created them because they were branded under other companies, our work has always been about invention and creativity.</p><p id="""">However, by 2014, the industry had shifted. Offshore manufacturing, among other changes, pushed us to explore new ways to raise awareness for our design brand. That’s when Tracy—an avid podcast listener—suggested starting a podcast.</p><p id="""">We dove in headfirst. For about nine months, we researched everything about podcasting. Tracy read 75 books on the subject, and we watched dozens of videos. Yet, we kept noticing gaps—things no one was telling us. So, we decided to approach podcasting differently, and honestly, we did it the hard way. We spent too much money figuring things out but eventually launched our first podcast in 2014.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s amazing. And what happened after you launched your first podcast?</strong></p><p id="""">Our first show, which focused on the niche topic of 3D printing, became an immediate success. Within a short time, <em id="""">Forbes</em> recognized it as one of the fastest-growing podcasts. We grew our audience to over 100,000 listeners and monetized the show through third-party sponsors.</p><p id="""">What set us apart was our willingness to innovate. Instead of following the standard advice, we tested unique strategies to maximize podcasting’s value. The results surprised even us. Other business professionals began noticing our success and asked if we could help them replicate it. At first, we hadn’t considered turning podcasting into a business, but the demand was undeniable.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s incredible that you transitioned your podcasting success into a business. What do you think contributed to that success right off the bat?</strong></p><p id="""">There were two key things: one related to the content we were creating and the other to the technology and distribution strategy.</p><p id="""">Every podcaster at the time was simply putting out audio shows. Back then, few were doing video because it was a lot more work. Most serious podcasters had websites with “show notes,” but those notes were usually just short summaries of the podcast.</p><p id="""">My business partner, Tracy, was a writer and a former columnist for <em id="""">Inc. Magazine</em>. She knew the power of blogging and suggested creating full-fledged blog posts for each episode. We also discovered that Google ranks blog content created from human speech very highly—higher than content that looks like it’s traditionally written.</p><p id="""">We realized we could use podcasts to generate high-value blog posts. Each episode provided powerful written content for our website. These blog posts ranked well for keywords and started driving traffic to our site.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s brilliant! So your podcast wasn’t just about creating audio content—it became the foundation for your entire content strategy. How effective was it?</strong></p><p id="""">It was incredibly effective. When we launched our 3D printing podcast, our website came out of Google’s “penalty box” in just over two months. Usually, it takes a new site four months or more to build trust with Google.</p><p id="""">Our blog posts, some as long as 5,000 or 6,000 words, became a massive driver of organic traffic. People searching for topics related to 3D printing found us through those posts. While we didn’t expect anyone to read the entire blog, the content still got us ranked and visible.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">SEO and the Longevity of Blog Content</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s incredible! So it wasn’t just about the podcast or the blog—it was about strategically using both to increase visibility. Can you expand on why the blog posts were so valuable?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Blogs are the most valuable part of the entire podcasting process for several reasons. First, while podcast listeners are a growing audience—around 115 million people in the U.S. alone each month—the search functionality within podcast apps is quite limited.</p><p id="""">Podcast directories like Apple Podcasts and Spotify only search titles and descriptions, not the full content of your episodes. On the other hand, Google indexes everything in a blog post, making it searchable for any topic discussed in the episode.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s huge. So Google essentially unlocks the potential of your content, allowing you to reach a much larger audience. But what about the long-term value of blogs?</strong></p><p id="""">The longevity of blog content is one of its biggest strengths. Blogs have staying power, unlike social media posts that lose relevance quickly. For example, blog posts we created for our 3D printing podcast six or seven years ago are still ranking on the first page of Google for certain keywords today.</p><p id="""">One time, I received an angry phone call from a CEO we mentioned in a podcast. He found out about it through a Google alert—just 11 hours after we published the blog post for that episode. That blog post started ranking on high-value keywords within a day and continues to rank years later.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s remarkable. So the blog posts not only increase visibility but also build equity in your website over time. And you mentioned earlier that Google ranks speech-based blogs higher than traditional written content. How does that work?</strong></p><p id="""">Google’s algorithms are designed to recognize human speech patterns. When your blog content is derived from a conversation—like a podcast—it ranks better because Google perceives it as authentic and valuable.</p><p id="""">However, there’s more to it than just slapping a transcript on a page. The content needs to be formatted properly and optimized for SEO. When done right, these blogs can rank for dozens of keyword phrases, driving organic traffic to your site consistently.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Multicasting: Maximizing Content Distribution</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve mentioned the idea of multicasting before. Can you explain how that works?</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. Multicasting is about taking a single piece of content and distributing it in multiple formats across various platforms. For example, one podcast episode can generate:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">A video for YouTube and your website</li><li id="""">An audio version for all major podcast apps</li><li id="""">A long-form blog post for your website</li><li id="""">Social media materials like graphics and video clips</li><li id="""">Additional micro-content like quotes or audiograms</li></ul><p id="""">By repurposing the content this way, you expand your reach without creating additional work.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So instead of just a podcast, you’re building an entire ecosystem of content that works together. How effective is this approach?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s extremely effective, especially for businesses. While podcasts and videos are great for connecting with your audience, the blog content provides the highest return on investment over time.</p><p id="""">For example, most podcasts produce weekly episodes, which is fantastic for building a loyal audience. But when you combine that with verbal SEO blog posts, you get long-term visibility and traffic. These blog posts act like magazine pages on your website, each one driving traffic and reinforcing your authority in your niche.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Building Authority and Maximizing Influence</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s talk about authority for a moment. One of the reasons I often recommend podcasting is its ability to establish credibility and trust in a space. How have you seen podcasting help people build authority?</strong></p><p id="""">There are so many ways podcasting builds authority. One major factor is name recognition. Years ago, being an author was the gold standard for credibility. If you had a book, you were seen as an expert in your field. But today, podcasts have taken that place.</p><p id="""">Look at news programs or talk shows. They used to feature authors with new books, but now they often invite podcast hosts. Having a podcast puts you on the map as an authority in your niche.</p><p id="""">Another powerful aspect is the connection you build with your audience. When someone listens to your podcast regularly, they feel like they know you. Your voice creates trust and familiarity, which is incredibly valuable. When you recommend something or share your expertise, your listeners are far more likely to engage and take action.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s so true. I’ve had people reach out to me after listening to my podcast, saying they felt like they already knew me. It’s such a unique way to build relationships. What about the strategic side of podcasting? How can people maximize their influence through their podcasts?</strong></p><p id="""">Maximizing influence comes down to being intentional about how you use your content. For instance, multicasting your podcast ensures it reaches as many people as possible. But it’s not just about distribution; it’s about making your content easy to consume and share.</p><p id="""">One of the best ways to do this is by creating content that serves multiple purposes. For example, if you interview a guest, you’re not only providing value to your audience but also tapping into the guest’s network when they share the episode.</p><p id="""">Another strategy is to focus on the longevity of your content. Podcasts combined with SEO-optimized blogs give you a dual benefit: short-term engagement with listeners and long-term visibility through search engines.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s an excellent point. Now, a common question I hear from people is, “Is it too late to start a podcast?” With so many podcasts out there, what’s your take on this?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s definitely not too late. The podcasting landscape is still growing, and the opportunity is huge. While it’s true there are millions of podcasts, only about 10% of them are actively publishing new episodes. That means there’s still plenty of room for new voices, especially if you approach podcasting strategically.</p><p id="""">What’s important to remember is that podcasting is a long-term investment. It takes time to build an audience and see results, but the sooner you start, the sooner you’ll benefit.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s reassuring to hear. I love how you frame it as a long-term investment. It’s about consistency and strategy.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s also about understanding that podcasting isn’t just about the number of listeners. It’s about reaching the right listeners. Even a small, engaged audience can have a significant impact on your business or personal brand.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Power of Promotion and Syndication</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve also mentioned promotion as a critical part of podcasting. What are some innovative ways podcasters can promote their shows?</strong></p><p id="""">One of the most effective strategies is what we call ""Promo Cast."" It’s a unique way to get your podcast in front of new audiences through targeted advertising.</p><p id="""">Promo Cast involves creating short, engaging soundbites from your episodes and using them as ads in a network of over 1,000 mobile apps. These ads reach people who aren’t already connected to you, raising awareness and driving traffic to your podcast.</p><p id="""">The beauty of this approach is its scalability. You can start small—spending just a couple hundred dollars a month—and still reach hundreds of thousands of potential listeners. Over time, this creates measurable growth in your audience.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a game-changer. So you’re essentially creating a marketing funnel for your podcast that’s affordable and effective.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. And the best part is that it works alongside all the other strategies we’ve talked about. By combining organic reach through blogs and SEO with targeted promotion, you can amplify your message and build a loyal audience.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion and Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love how you’ve broken this down. Podcasting isn’t just about recording episodes—it’s about creating an entire ecosystem of content that builds authority, drives visibility, and fosters meaningful connections. As we wrap up, what advice would you give to someone who’s thinking about starting a podcast but hasn’t taken the leap yet?</strong></p><p id="""">The best advice I can give is to start as soon as possible. The most common question I get is, “When should I start my podcast?” The answer is always, “Last month.” Starting now gives you the time to grow your audience, refine your content, and realize the long-term benefits of podcasting.</p><p id="""">Also, don’t let perfectionism stop you. Your first episodes won’t be perfect, and that’s okay. What matters is getting your message out there and improving as you go.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such valuable advice. And it’s a great reminder that podcasting is a journey. As long as you start, you’re already ahead of the game.

George Wright III here. I’m joined by an amazing individual. You guys are going to be completely blown away today because we’re going to be talking tech, business, health, mindset, and all kinds of different things.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m joined by what I like to call a system architect, Greg Anderson. He’s an entrepreneur, an author, a producer, and a very, very successful guy. He believes you can systematize anything if you learn the rules of the game. His current passion project is the Jedari platform, which is what we’re using to launch our Mastermind X program and our private mastermind.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Just to give you a little bit about Greg—he’s done over $100 million in coaching, 350 custom builds, works with the biggest names in the industry, and has a long, impressive pedigree. Welcome to the podcast, Greg. How are you doing, man?</strong></p><p id="""">I’m fantastic today. It’s good to be here. It’s always nice to hear somebody say something about you, especially when you’re like, ""Oh yeah, I have done that. Oh yeah."" Because sometimes we just forget. As entrepreneurs, you just bulldoze through and keep working. Then you look back and realize, wow, there’s a pretty cool list of things we’ve accomplished so far.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I know. I was thinking just in the last year—gosh, we’ve had you featured in several of our magazines. You’ve been involved when we had Neil Patel, one of the best marketers in the world, on the cover. You’ve got businesses moving, but our conversations go everywhere from mindset and mental health to business and strategy.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Today, I’ll try my best to keep us focused just a little bit for everyone listening. Do me a favor—give us a little bit about yourself and maybe what’s led you to your current passion around Jedari. For people who don’t know you, share a bit of your background.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Greg Anderson’s Background and Journey</strong></h3><p id="""">Yeah, for sure. You know, it’s a great conversation because even now, I’m learning more about myself all the time. I grew up in Utah, dyslexic, and in resource classes for everything—math, social studies, English. Originally, I always looked at that as a bad thing. My high school guidance counselor told me, ""Hey, Greg, labor for construction is a good career. Don’t think about college.""</p><p id="""">But later in life, as things unfolded, I learned there are just different ways of processing information. The way the school system processed information wasn’t wrong or right; it just didn’t necessarily work for me. Years later, I was at a dinner with the lieutenant governor and his wife. She explained to me that there are 10 different levels of dyslexia. The Utah school system could only manage two. The other eight? They didn’t have the knowledge, skill sets, or whatever was needed to help people like me.</p><p id="""">So, I grew up feeling like an outsider. Flash forward 20 years—after education, personal development, NLPs, Tony Robbins seminars, and all kinds of learning—I realized that this was actually my superpower. The fact that I wasn’t classically trained on how to put things in boxes, or how those boxes should even exist, meant I got to figure it out for myself. That, and maybe a high degree of Asperger’s, because I rank on that chart and get pretty intense about some things.</p><p id="""">But these are like superpowers. They allow me to look at life and business as systems. Whether it’s health, fitness, business, or even relationships, there’s always an underlying system. If you take the time to look, you’ll learn how to excel in whatever area you’re focused on. For example, if you want your body to perform a certain way, there’s a specific way to eat and train. If I wanted to be a long-distance runner, I wouldn’t eat and train like a powerlifter. There’s a system for everything.</p><p id="""">And the same applies to business. If you’re in business and you’re not looking at your math and money, your system is failing.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that because I think most people who work around me see how I’ve evolved—not just in my personal life, but in business too. Once you start recognizing systems, blueprints, and the way you think and act, you realize how everything connects. The marketplace is no exception.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s one reason I think you’ve done so well—you’ve evolved how you do things over time. More and more, I think people are becoming holistic, which is why, with our mastermind community, we focus on mind, body, money, and business to create a lifestyle. It’s not just about making a lot of money.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m curious—recently, you and I talked about how our mastermind and podcast focus on building authority. I’d like to go down this road and talk about content and community. You’ve built massive communities and worked with some of the biggest leaders. What can businesses do, and how should they think about content? I think your perspective is critical for people.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Building Authority Through Content and Community</strong></h3><p id="""">I love it. To set it up and dive deeper, content as a business blankets a lot of things. But it’s also one of the most sought-after business models right now. Private equity firms, venture capitalists, and family offices are all looking for businesses with content attached to them.</p><p id="""">Take sports teams, for example. Every athlete is essentially a content provider for their group of fans, and businesses create entire ecosystems around that. Or look at masterminds or even something like HVAC contractors. Imagine an HVAC contractor who has a great way of doing business—how they manage employees, set contracts, or market themselves. That knowledge is content. They can sell or train others using that information.</p><p id="""">Not everyone recognizes this, but the marketplace is shifting. Social media exploded because people gave content away for free. It made platforms like Facebook and Instagram successful. But now, businesses realize that maybe they don’t want to give everything away for free on platforms that market to their audience all the time. Maybe they want to pull that content into a private world they control—through a community app, learning management system, or another tool.</p><p id="""">That shift from content as a free tool to content as a business is massive.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Monetizing Content and Creating Private Communities</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to talk a little more about that. But first, let’s break it down for some of the people listening. As the marketplace shifts and evolves, like you said, whether it’s product development, personal growth, or business strategy, recognizing the value of content is critical.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You mentioned that private equity, banks, and others value content because it levels the playing field. Small businesses now have something unique to differentiate themselves. Can you explain why it’s important to contain content and build private communities rather than just posting everything on free platforms?</strong></p><p id="""">If we think of free social media as the ""intrigue"" step in sales, it makes sense. In sales, you have to do three things: get someone interested in your product, convert their mindset to see its value, and finally, complete the sale. Social media is primarily about intrigue. It’s designed to spark interest in what you offer.</p><p id="""">For example, if I’m an attorney, my social media posts might focus on getting people interested in either working with me or learning from me. But here’s the critical piece—social media is just the starting point. The real value happens when you take that interest and move it into a private environment, whether that’s a community, app, or other controlled space. That’s where the real money is made.</p><p id="""">There’s also a practical reason for this. Some industries, like medicine or law, face restrictions on what they can post publicly. For example, a stem cell doctor might want to share the latest research but would risk being shut down by the FDA if it’s on a public platform. However, in a private community, they can freely share that information with their audience.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what you’re saying is that businesses need to move beyond just creating value through content. They need to control their content, create exclusivity, and provide a dedicated environment where their audience can engage with them directly.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. By building a private community, businesses can avoid the pitfalls of public platforms. Let’s say you spend years cultivating an audience on Facebook or Instagram. Those platforms can still market to your audience, and you don’t own that data. Worse, if they shut down your account, you lose everything.</p><p id="""">When you create a private environment, you have full control. You’re not only protecting your audience but also delivering a more tailored experience. You can livestream, deliver content, host discussions, and gather feedback—all within your branded ecosystem. This gives you freedom, control, and the ability to directly influence your audience without distractions.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Getting Started with Content Creation</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That makes perfect sense. But let’s back up a bit. What would you say to someone who wants to start creating content but feels overwhelmed? They might think, “I don’t know if I’m good at this,” or, “Doesn’t it take a lot of time?” How should they approach it?</strong></p><p id="""">Great question. Anyone with a product or service has something to offer, whether they realize it or not. There are really two avenues to start with: time or money.</p><p id="""">If you’re just starting and don’t have a big budget, you’ll need to invest your time and effort into creating content. This might mean learning to make videos, writing blog posts, or getting featured in a magazine. These actions build your authority. You’re essentially trading your time and energy for exposure.</p><p id="""">The second avenue is using paid ads. You can pay to get in front of your audience by buying ad space or partnering with influencers. Over time, most businesses find a balance between the two. They create content organically and supplement it with paid campaigns.</p><p id="""">At its core, the goal is to build authority and capture attention. Whether you’re selling a product, a service, or yourself as a brand, having authority makes you more valuable.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think that’s such an important point. Many of our listeners are CEOs, entrepreneurs, or business owners, and I’ve been doubling down on the importance of building a personal brand. It’s not just about creating content for your business—it’s about positioning yourself as an expert in your field.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. One of the greatest marketers of all time, Dan Kennedy, said, ""If you’re not becoming a celebrity in your niche, you’re underutilizing your potential."" Personal branding is about building authority in your space, and that authority attracts opportunities you can’t plan for.</p><p id="""">I’ve seen it happen over and over. A strong personal brand leads to partnerships, equity deals, and other opportunities you didn’t even know existed. That’s why creating content and building your brand is so valuable—it opens doors beyond just growing your business.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s shift gears a bit. You’ve done an incredible job combining technology with community building. Many people think of building a following on Facebook or Instagram, but you’ve approached it differently. How have you blended technology to give businesses more control and intentionality with their content?</strong></p><p id="""">Over the years, I’ve built various software platforms—some focused on making money, others designed purely for bringing people together. Eventually, I started creating hybrids that could do both.</p><p id="""">For example, the Jedari platform was born out of the idea that businesses need an all-in-one solution. If you’re running a community, you shouldn’t have to rely on Zoom for video, WhatsApp for messaging, and a separate platform for payments. Instead, everything—communication, learning, and transactions—can happen in one place, branded specifically for your business.</p><p id="""">This approach solves several problems. First, it keeps your audience focused on your brand. Second, it ensures their data isn’t shared with third parties. And finally, it gives you complete control over the user experience.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Why Ownership Matters</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a game-changer. I can’t tell you how many successful people I know who built their business on social media, only to lose their accounts and start from scratch. When you own the platform, you also own the experience, the data, and the future of your business.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Think about it: You could upload a great YouTube video, but as soon as it ends, viewers are shown other people’s content. Or you might have ads running on top of your work. It dilutes your message. By creating a private environment, you remove those distractions and provide a more intentional experience for your audience.</p><p id="""">For example, with your mastermind app, we’ve created an exclusive space where elite entrepreneurs can connect, share content, and engage without interference. You can livestream, host discussions, and deliver courses—all while maintaining control. That’s the power of combining technology with community building.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Passion, Purpose, and Mindset</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I wanted to shift gears again because, Greg, you’re not just driven by business and technology. You’ve been incredibly successful in those areas, but I know you’re also passionate about the human experience—about evolving into the best version of yourself. That’s something I admire about you. Can you talk about why passion, purpose, and mindset are so important to you?</strong></p><p id="""">For sure. When I look at the world today, it’s all over the place. We’ve got some of the best living conditions in history, but also some of the worst. There are epidemics of obesity and starvation happening simultaneously. It’s wild.</p><p id="""">To make a positive impact on the world, I believe it’s my job to evolve, to grow, and to experience life fully. And let’s be real—becoming wealthy is a part of that. When you’re financially secure, you can make a bigger impact. You can help others, fund initiatives, and create change. But the foundation for all of that is being healthy—mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.</p><p id="""">That’s why I focus so much on personal growth. It’s not just about building businesses or making money. It’s about becoming the kind of person who can genuinely make the world a better place. If you’re not evolving, you’re not fulfilling your potential.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s powerful. So, with the Jedari platform, you’re combining your passion for growth and your expertise in technology. You’ve built something that not only helps businesses but also empowers people to share knowledge and connect in meaningful ways.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. One of the key drivers behind Jedari was creating a platform where people could control their own narrative. I wanted a space where people could communicate freely, as long as they weren’t breaking laws, and share ideas without interference. Communication is how we solve problems, grow, and make an impact.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Disrupting Success to Evolve Further</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love what you’re saying about growth and evolution. It reminds me of something you said in an article we featured in <em id="""">Valiant CEO</em>. You talked about the idea of “disrupting your success.” I think that resonates with a lot of people at the top of their game who feel like something’s missing. Can you elaborate on that?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, I remember that article. The idea behind disrupting success is that no matter how good you are, there’s always another level. Think about the best athletes in the world. They spend countless hours on the fundamentals. A basketball player practices free throws. A pitcher perfects their form. They don’t skip the basics, even when they’re at the top.</p><p id="""">In my own life, there was a point where I thought I had it all. I was making great money, had the cars, the lifestyle—but I wasn’t happy. So, I stripped everything down. I left the country, went nomadic, and spent time focusing on what really mattered. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend going that extreme, but I do think it’s important to reassess and work on the areas you’ve been neglecting.</p><p id="""">If you’re feeling like something’s missing, it’s probably because there’s a part of your foundation that needs attention. Maybe it’s your health, your relationships, or even your mindset. When you work on those fundamentals, everything else rises with it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a great insight. And I love that you’re tying it back to systems. Whether it’s business or personal growth, it’s all about rebuilding the foundation to reach the next level. That’s something I’d love to explore more the next time we chat.</strong></p><p id="""">I’d love that too. Rebuilding isn’t just about fixing what’s broken; it’s about evolving. Whether it’s your business, your systems, or yourself, there’s always room for growth. And the exciting part is, when you approach it with the right mindset, the possibilities are endless.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts and How to Connect with Greg</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Before we wrap up, what’s the easiest way for people to connect with you?</strong></p><p id="""">For me personally, it’s Instagram or Facebook.

George Wright III here your host. Today, we’re going to talk shop. I’m excited to have Colton Page here with me. How are you doing today?</strong></p><p id="""">I’m doing great. Happy to be here.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I know this is good. It’s been tough for two busy guys to get together, but I’m excited because here, a lot of the CEOs, owners, and entrepreneurs we talk with love the mindset and lifestyle topics. But at the end of the day, it’s about business. And today, we’re going to feature a topic I haven’t covered before—payments.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">For everyone who doesn’t know Colton, let me give you a quick introduction. Colton Page is the Chief Sales Officer and Co-owner of PlatPay, a cutting-edge merchant processing company with over 20 years of experience. PlatPay has processed over a billion dollars in transactions and is a leader in banking, redundancy, and tailored payment solutions.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Colton has also been instrumental in securing the company’s largest clients and driving innovation. He holds a dual bachelor’s degree in International Business and Finance, bringing a global perspective to his role. But here’s what’s really interesting—he started as a door-to-door sales rep and grew into managing a team of 40 reps, generating $6 million in sales. His hands-on approach has helped him develop leadership, resilience, and relationship-building skills. He’s passionate about technology and financial systems, which we’ll dive into today. So, welcome to the podcast, man. I appreciate you being here. A lot going on, right?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, yeah. Tons going on, but I always make time.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Behind the Scenes of Business Success</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You know what I love about your industry? You see so many different types of businesses. You kind of have a pulse on what’s working and what’s not. Would you agree?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, for better or worse, we get to see behind the curtain. We go to a lot of masterminds where people share what’s working and what’s not. But ultimately, we get to see what’s actually working because numbers don’t lie.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Right. That’s what I love. Especially today, with AI and marketing, you don’t always know who’s real or who’s succeeding. Everyone looks like a success online. But you have the data to see who’s actually driving results. Let’s back up a bit. You started in door-to-door sales, right? Going from that to Chief Sales Officer and Co-owner of PlatPay is a big leap. How did that happen?</strong></p><p id="""">I started late—at 25—while I was married and in school. My brother-in-law and I built a team, and over four years, we owned a couple of offices and handled day-to-day operations. It wasn’t just about selling anymore. We were managing technicians, trucks, products, and reps—all while still selling ourselves.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow, so you were managing everything—sales, logistics, operations. That’s a lot.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It got to the point where my wife stopped coming out with me for the summers because I was working from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.</p><p id="""">Eventually, I realized I loved recruiting and working with the team, but I didn’t want to rely on recruiting 20-year-olds for my financial success. That’s when I pivoted. I had worked at PlatPay before, so I reached out to Jed, my partner. We came up with a strategic plan to build PlatPay together. It’s been a great two-and-a-half years since.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Value of Sales Skills</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s interesting because I also started in sales. I think a lot of young entrepreneurs miss out because they don’t develop those foundational skills. They want to jump straight into being influencers or building online funnels without learning how to work with customers. Do you think those skills were critical to your success?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. First, they got me in the door to co-own PlatPay. Second, the discipline and lessons from door-to-door sales are invaluable. I honestly think everyone should try summer sales, even if they’re bad at it.</p><p id="""">When you’re out there, it’s just you, your thoughts, and the challenge of convincing strangers to trust you.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And there’s a lot of rejection, right?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, yeah. You figure out your ratio—like, “For every 20 people, I’ll get one sale.” It’s a mental game. But the discipline and tenacity you develop carry over into everything else, from sales to customer service.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Exactly. Sales often gets a bad rap, but it’s really about communication and persuasion. And those are skills everyone needs. Let’s talk about PlatPay. You’ve been in the payment processing space for a while now. How do you differentiate yourselves in such a competitive market?</strong></p><p id="""">It started with my dad’s telemarketing company. They kept getting their merchant accounts shut down. So, they either had to create their own solution or find a processor that understood their business model. That’s how PlatPay was born.</p><p id="""">We specialized in high-risk industries like coaching and continuity. Over time, we grew by attending masterminds and building relationships. Unlike other processors who rely on leads or cold outreach, we’ve always focused on relationships and referrals.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Adding Value and Building Relationships</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a unique approach. It sounds like you’ve focused on adding value and building long-term relationships, rather than just chasing leads. How else do you think you stand out?</strong></p><p id="""">For us, it’s about going beyond just taking payments. We ask, “How can we help your business grow?” If we can add value—whether it’s introducing clients to strategic partners or helping them generate more revenue—it benefits everyone in the long run.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. By creating value and building trust, you make it less about who’s offering the cheapest deal and more about the relationship. Let’s talk about something you’ve mentioned before: banking redundancy. What does that mean in the context of payment processing, and how does it benefit businesses?</strong></p><p id="""">A lot of people think redundancy means having multiple processors, but that’s only part of it. True redundancy happens at the banking level. For example, if you use three processors that all rely on the same bank, and that bank has an issue, you’re stuck.</p><p id="""">We work to diversify not just the processors but the banks behind them. This ensures that if one account gets frozen or shut down—due to chargebacks, refunds, or rapid growth—you’re not left stranded. It’s about building a safety net for our clients.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such an important point, especially for businesses that only think about processing after they run into problems. What are the biggest challenges you see businesses facing when it comes to payment processing?</strong></p><p id="""">One major challenge is that many businesses start with platforms like Stripe. Don’t get me wrong—Stripe is great for quick setups and integrations, but it’s not a true merchant account. Stripe is an aggregator, so you’re lumped in with thousands of other accounts.</p><p id="""">If one of those accounts causes an issue, it can trigger an audit that affects everyone. We’ve had clients come to us after realizing they built their entire system around Stripe, only to have their funds frozen. Fixing that after the fact is a heavy lift, involving new integrations and development work.</p><p id="""">My advice? Start with scalability in mind. Build flexibility into your systems and avoid relying on a single processor or platform.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fraud and chargebacks are also huge concerns for businesses, especially in e-commerce. How does PlatPay help clients protect themselves?</strong></p><p id="""">Fraud is a big issue, and it’s only getting more sophisticated. We address this at both the gateway and processor levels by using settings and strategies to mitigate risk. For businesses with high transaction volumes or lower dollar thresholds, we recommend specialized chargeback management platforms.</p><p id="""">Back in the day, we handled chargebacks ourselves, but now there are tools that can track everything—from IP addresses to multiple credit card uses by the same individual. These systems help identify and block repeat offenders, giving businesses an extra layer of protection.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Adapting to Rapid Change</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">The financial and payment processing landscape is changing so quickly with AI, blockchain, and emerging technologies. How do you keep up?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s a daily effort. We attend banking conferences and stay in close contact with our partners to stay informed. FedNow, for example, is a big development. While it’s positioned as just “helping” right now, it’s likely to become a major player by offering instant payouts.</p><p id="""">Visa and other processors are adapting as well, and blockchain is continuing to grow in relevance. It’s all about staying ahead by aligning with the right partners and being proactive in adopting new technology.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s talk about Payment Cowboys. You’ve mentioned it a few times. What is it, and how did it come about?</strong></p><p id="""">Payment Cowboys is one of our niche initiatives designed to serve businesses in the Western and cowboy communities. We partnered with Casey Field, a six-time world champion bareback rider, to create a brand that embodies grit, hard work, and doing what’s right.</p><p id="""">The goal was to take our expertise in payment processing and tailor it to a specific audience. Part of our profits go to cowboy charities, so we’re not just providing a service—we’re giving back to the community.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a creative approach. You’ve taken a fairly generic product, like payment processing, and turned it into something with a cause and a connection to a specific group. That’s inspiring.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s about finding ways to stand out while staying true to our values. We want to make a difference in a way that goes beyond transactions.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Balancing Growth and Relationships</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’re growing rapidly, but growth can be tricky. How do you balance scaling your business with maintaining strong relationships with clients?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s definitely a challenge. We’re a lean team, so we wear a lot of hats. We use automated systems to handle routine tasks, but we make sure to maintain a personal touch.</p><p id="""">Even though we’ve been around for 20 years, I treat PlatPay like a startup. That mindset keeps us focused on growth while ensuring we don’t lose sight of what’s important—our clients.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">When do you know it’s time to expand your team or bring in more resources?</strong></p><p id="""">For me, it’s when I hit 120% of my capacity and deals start slipping. That’s my signal to hire. But we’re selective. We look for people with a strong work ethic who share our dedication to customer service.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s your vision for the next 5–10 years? What are your big goals?</strong></p><p id="""">We have growth goals across three areas: FinTech, operations, and sales. We want to streamline our onboarding process, build stronger banking relationships, and grow niches like Payment Cowboys.</p><p id="""">At the same time, we’ll continue treating PlatPay like a startup. That mindset helps us stay innovative and adaptable.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. A startup mentality keeps you agile and focused. For anyone interested in connecting with you or learning more about PlatPay or Payment Cowboys, what’s the best way to reach out?</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We’ll include links in the show notes.

Welcome.</strong></p><p id="""">Hey, thanks for having me, man. Thank you so much.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">This is good. Listen, I know we had a chance to talk a little bit beforehand, but I think we're gonna get into some cool stuff. Before we do, I want to give them a little bit of your background. Titus is the CEO and founder of the Ultimate End Gamer League (UEL). His goal is for that to be the NFL of eSports.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But you’ve got a pretty diverse background. You've gone from real estate to gaming to starting your own company, growing a community, and creating a brand. We're gonna get into all of that. I really love what you've done in a very short period of time, so you’ve got some great nuggets I'm sure you can share with our audience. So once again, super glad to have you here, man.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, thanks. Thanks so much, man. Appreciate the intro too.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">No worries, no worries. And I know we're gonna be able to do some other things too in the future. So let's do this.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Titus Walker's Background and Early Hustles</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I always like to give our audience a little bit of a framework for the success that you and I touched on. So help us understand where you came from, right? You mentioned that you've been in real estate and then you went into this. Let's just start real quick with Titus's background. Did you grow up like a side hustle type of guy? Where did you come from and how did you get into real estate?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely always been a side hustle guy. I was introduced to gaming when I was probably like five or six years old. It was Mortal Kombat. My dad introduced me to Mortal Kombat 1 on Sega Genesis, and I loved it. Just fell in love with gaming. I played a lot of games as a kid.</p><p id="""">Fast forward to elementary school, I was selling candy bars. I found out you could buy candy bars in bulk, and I'm doing the math in my head and talking to my mom like, ""Hey, we can sell these for a lot more and make a lot of money."" She would take me to the store, and I’d buy a bunch of candy bars and sell them.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That's funny you say that. I was just at dinner last night talking to buddies about how I used to buy those boxes of candy bars at school. I'd have 'em in my duffel bag, and I'd just always be the guy like, ""Yeah, you need something to eat? Here you go."" Constantly all the time. That's funny. Okay, keep going.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, graduated from that, started selling sneakers, did that very successfully, and then got into the insurance world. I was doing both—selling sneakers and doing the insurance thing. Then I actually got sick.</p><p id="""">I don't even know what the sickness was, but I got really sick. While I was sick, I was thinking a lot because I was in the hospital. I realized I wanted to try something different. I happened to get an email saying a company was hiring, and it was a real estate developer. I had never heard of it, but I figured I'd put myself out there. I went to an interview, got hired, and that transitioned me into the real estate world. I did really well—hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue over my eight-year career.</p><p id="""">I did a lot throughout that time, my own real estate deals, and eventually created the gaming thing about four years ago.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me back you up. Just a question: What do you think was one of the keys to your success in a brand-new industry? You were in it eight years, you said you did all this success. Was it all up and to the right, easygoing? Did you have to study a lot? What helped you become successful in an industry you had no clue about?</strong></p><p id="""">I think in everything I've ever done, I spend a lot of time understanding the industry and the people around the industry. Nowadays, you really can find out anything you ever want to know, whether it's true or not, online. Once that concept hit me—oh, I can find this somewhere—it changed everything.</p><p id="""">I started Googling everything. I crave knowledge, so I read a lot. I never read a book until I was 28, but since then, I read six or seven books a month easily. That was key. When I get into an industry, I want to know it inside and out. I didn’t just study the real estate market; I studied the financial market, the economy, and industries outside of housing, like the lumber industry.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You're an active learner, for sure. It's funny because we say this a lot on this podcast, but you hear it in personal and financial development—you’ve gotta be curious and an active learner. People sometimes feel they're too busy and don't realize the value of that. Obviously, success leaves clues, and if individuals like yourself are learning and evolving, that's a big reason for your success.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Curiosity and Transition to Gaming</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">From what you told me earlier, it’s probably another reason that you went into gaming. Your curiosity and exposure to people and things put you out there to be aware of opportunities. So tell us a little bit about what took you into gaming. I know people think, “I want to make money gaming,” and then think, “Oh my gosh, dude.” But nowadays, it's legit, right? What was the transition point? Were you thinking, “Is this even possible?” or, “I got this”? What was the transition?</strong></p><p id="""">When studying the market, I saw how cyclical it was—so many ups and downs. I kept telling my wife, “I have to have something else because I won’t depend on this one industry.” I didn’t want to be left holding the bag when the market took a turn.</p><p id="""">I started a trading company and poured money into other businesses, trying to make them work. But none of them drove me. I’d try something because I needed to, but eventually, something clicked. When I started the gaming arcade idea and really researched it, something felt different. It was clear the industry had serious needs, but it was also broken.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me stop you for a second because I think people need to really understand the point you just made. People are so busy living their lives, they aren’t looking to prepare themselves. That’s the first point. The second is they say, “I don’t know what I want to do,” and you’re saying you just started trying things—trading, investing, whatever. You were looking. Do you feel you would’ve even come across gaming if you hadn’t been out there looking?</strong></p><p id="""">No, absolutely not. At the end of the day, I was very successful. I bought a nine-bedroom house, drove a Porsche, and people would tell me, “Why are you doing this? Can’t you just be happy with what you have?” It was hard to explain because there was just that drive—this isn’t it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It doesn’t sound like you weren’t happy with real estate. It seems like you’re happy doing whatever you want. But you felt the need to diversify. Is that safe to say?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, it was more that I wanted to continue to grow. I’m addicted to progress—addicted to it. If I don’t see progress, I struggle. I even have this daily game I play because it’s about progress. It’s 10 minutes in the morning, but it gives me that little sense of accomplishment and fuels my day.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You literally have a game you do every day to give you that progress? That’s cool. I’m going to need more details on that! But let’s go back—you said you came across gaming. Was it a passion first or the opportunity? What drew you to it?</strong></p><p id="""">It was the opportunity at first. I thought, “I can create this; it’s something I love.” But as I dove into the research, something clicked. I had the University of Mary Washington put together a research piece. They told me the industry was worth $150 billion, and the average gamer plays 24 games a year. I thought, “Why would I pigeonhole myself into one game?”</p><p id="""">That’s exactly it. Every other gaming competition is one game. So I started thinking, “Why on earth would I focus on just one game when gamers play an average of 24 games a year?” It didn’t make sense. I dove deeper into the research and realized there was an entire untapped opportunity.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Building the Ultimate End Gamer League (UEL)</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So you decided to build the UEL. But let me ask you—how did you figure out what to do? Did you pattern what you did off the track record of the NFL or other major leagues?</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. I didn’t go out and say, “How do I create the UEL?” I said, “How did the NBA, NFL, and MLB start? How did they create a new industry?” Because that’s what they did. The NBA owns basketball. If they change a rule, the entire sport changes. Same with the NFL and football. They control their industries.</p><p id="""">But eSports? No one owns it. It’s fragmented—different games, different developers. Nobody controls the industry. I wanted to change that. I realized I needed to control not the games, but the people around the games.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a paradigm shift. Instead of focusing on games, you focused on creating an industry. That’s genius. But it must’ve been hard to get people to shift their thinking. What did you do?</strong></p><p id="""">It was tough. I spent three years convincing people. Everyone told me I was wrong. They said, “This will never work. Just do it the way everyone else does.” But I kept going. I focused on building a community first.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Gaming as an Art Form</strong></h3><p id="""">Gaming has never been seen as an art form, but I believe it is. It’s a form of expression. How you play a game reflects your personality and creativity. eSports doesn’t allow for that. There are rigid rules—play this way or it doesn’t count.</p><p id="""">I opened it up. I said, “Play the game however you want. Express yourself.” Over time, people started to see it. They realized this was something special.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s huge. You created an environment where people could express themselves. That’s a rare mindset in gaming. But it also sounds like you were patient. You waited three years before people started to buy in. How did you keep going through all the doubts?</strong></p><p id="""">It was hard. But I believed in what I was building. I felt peace about it, even during the tough times. My business partners backed out. My job gave me an ultimatum. I lost $150,000 a year for three years. But I never wavered.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. That kind of commitment is rare. So now you’ve built the UEL. Tell us, where is it today? What’s the vision?</strong></p><p id="""">We’re in Season Seven. The competition is for $100,000, and we give out $300,000 a year. But the vision is so much bigger. I believe the UEL will be bigger than the NFL, NBA, and MLB combined.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a bold vision, but with 2.5 billion gamers worldwide, it’s not hard to see the potential. What would you say to someone who has a big dream but is struggling to make it happen?</strong></p><p id="""">You have to commit. Decide that you’re going to do it no matter what. Don’t dabble. Don’t wait for the perfect plan. Just start. And don’t let the doubts stop you. Keep going, even when it’s hard.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts and How to Get Involved</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s powerful advice. I love it.

My name’s George Wright III. I am your host and I’m here with an incredible guest today. I’m really excited to have you on with us. Charlie Chen, how are you?</strong></p><p id="""">I’m doing great. Thanks. How are you, George?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Good, good. I’m glad that we’re able to coordinate. A lot of times busy entrepreneurs, it’s difficult, but we are going to get into some really good stuff today. It goes along the lines with several conversations I’ve been having with some of my mentoring clients lately.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Charlie’s Background and Early Life</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">But I want to give everyone an intro real quick to your background. So for those of you that don’t know Charlie, he’s the founder of Ultra Wellness Gear and he’s a serial entrepreneur. He’s really been doing a lot of things over the years. He’s currently focused on wellness tools and mindset coaching that help people get their lives, agencies, and businesses in line. He was recently featured in Valiant CEO, which is where I met him, and we’re excited to have him on. He was born in Taiwan, moved to California at five, and actually spent part of his childhood in a Buddhist monastery. He was a monk from nine to fourteen. We’re going to talk a little about that as well. But he studied graphic design and art at UC Davis.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">He worked across different industries—from life insurance and timeshare to telecommunications and sales support—but made some major breakthroughs in personal development, where he uncovered a framework that we’re going to talk about today. Charlie, I’m excited to have you, but I’d love for you to start us out by giving us a little bit of background as to why you were living in a monastery for some of your early years.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, thanks for asking that, George. So interestingly enough, my mom had decided unanimously to become a Buddhist nun after listening to a lecture by our Buddhist master. Even though my dad had begged her to stay, once she makes up her mind—it’s made. The funny thing is, she asked her friend to take care of my dad, meaning be his wife. That’s a whole other story, but wow, that lady did end up becoming my stepmom—not right away, though. It was crazy, unheard of.</p><p id="""">When she decided to become a nun, our master’s main headquarters was in northern California in a small city called Ukiah, a couple of hours north of the Bay Area. When she moved there, she brought me, my older brother, her mom (my grandma), and a cousin as well. So it was quite interesting that my mom, my grandma, and my cousin all became Buddhist nuns right there and then when I was five years old. That’s how we got started on that journey.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. And it’s come full circle because that really gave you this whole foundation of mindset and awareness. Tell me how that shaped your career as you went into adulthood. Give me a little bit of that background.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. So growing up in the monastery, living among monks and nuns, it was quite different. It was all about detaching from worldly desires and living a simple life—no internet, no shopping, no distractions. It was almost like an Amish community.</p><p id="""">Coming into the real world, as they say, was a culture shock. But at the same time, it gave me, like you said, that mindfulness—the ability not to get caught up in “keeping up with the Joneses.” The other part of it was also a mindset shift because within certain cultures, we’re taught that money is evil. But how does that work if we’re trying to get ahead? That’s conflicting, right? I had to make mindset shifts around that to overcome it.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Transition to Business and Personal Development</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s interesting though that even with that background, you went right into business. You’ve had a lot of success in several industries—from telecom to sales and support—and you’ve been featured in Valiant CEO because of a major pivot you made. I’d like to know what your perspective is on overall wellness and mindset, both physical and mental. What was the reason you decided to go down that path?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, so interestingly enough, the whole mindset thing was born out of my first entrepreneurial endeavor in the life insurance industry straight out of college. Through that, I learned about personal development and leadership. I was introduced to Landmark Education, and I love to give credit where credit is due. It didn’t teach me something new—it put into words the teachings I grew up with in the monastery.</p><p id="""">It gave me language to unpack the things that were “running the show,” if you will. Everything that happens—human beings are meaning-making machines—we make a story out of it. Sometimes we don’t let go of those stories, and they end up driving our lives without us realizing it.</p><p id="""">Making that discovery was a huge breakthrough. I was able to get complete with whatever past was holding me back and invent new possibilities. For me, it goes back to the Buddhist concept of the Bodhisattva path—an enlightened being who serves others before reaching Nirvana. Once I found that for myself, it was a natural next step to empower others with that same discovery.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">“We may be through with our past, but our past may not be through with us. Once you realize that, you can finally create something new.”</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And it’s interesting because I’m sure this applies broadly—but who do you think in business benefits most from these principles and teachings?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, I would say businesses focused on developing their people into leaders. Some business owners still maintain that top-down, command-and-control structure—they just want employees to follow orders. That’s not who I serve. I work with business owners who want to develop people and leaders—both in themselves and in their teams.</p><blockquote id=""""><em id="""">“Leadership isn’t about control—it’s about creating more leaders. Empowered people create empowered results.”</em></blockquote><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Mindset and Wellness Journey</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I think that’s a good distinction because people work in all kinds of environments—some are founders, CEOs, or business owners themselves. What would you say is one of the differentiating factors in achieving success? I think this goes straight to what you do differently, because you’ve combined physical wellness products with mindset and systems. What do you do differently that has made a bigger impact for people and created more significant change in their development?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, I would say start at the root level. But before dealing with the root, you want to begin with the end in mind, which is one of <em id="""">The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em> by John Maxwell.</p><p id="""">When we talk about what we want our lives to look like, it’s about designing from imagination—not memory. Don’t base it on what’s “realistic” from your past experiences, because that’s limiting. Once you have that vision, you need to look at the root—what’s actually getting in the way of fulfilling that?</p><p id="""">Because if that’s what we want, why haven’t we achieved it yet? So, I look deeper into those layers—like peeling an onion—until we get to the core. Everyone has access to the same information in this digital age; the only real difference is mindset. That’s the distinction between someone like you, George, and someone with the same talents but who isn’t applying themselves to make an impact.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Would you agree that distinction makes all the difference?</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I do. And I think there’s both the motivation to do it and also uncovering those internal battles or obstacles that hold you back. It comes back to awareness. So, when you’re working with people, you’ve talked about this three-step transformation process. I know we’ve touched on it, but maybe walk me through that process for our listeners.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Three-Step Transformation Process</h3><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely. I’ll share my own story to demonstrate how those three steps played out for me.</p><p id="""">The first step is <strong id="""">uncovering your story</strong>. There’s always a story we believe about ourselves—whether we’re aware of it or not. Sometimes it’s buried deep in the subconscious, that “blind spot” of things we don’t even know we don’t know. The scary part is, that story is often what’s running the show—pulling the strings behind our reactions to circumstances.</p><p id="""">For me, I realized I had a pattern of procrastination—constantly waiting until the last minute. I’d justify it, telling myself I was just making the most of my time.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, we rationalize it, huh?</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly—we rationalize it. During a Landmark Education seminar, my seminar leader finally called me out on it. That’s another aspect of leadership—accountability. Being willing to do the right thing for others, even if it means not being popular.</p><p id="""">She called me out, and we unpacked it. I discovered that story came from when I was twelve years old, living as a Buddhist monk. We were visiting the headquarters monastery in Ukiah, California, and during an evening lecture with hundreds of people, one of the monks asked if someone from our novice group would come on stage to recite a Sanskrit mantra from memory. I volunteered.</p><p id="""">Halfway through, I forgot a few lines. I don’t remember if I finished—I just remember running out of the hall, crying. In that moment, though I didn’t speak it aloud, I told myself: <em id="""">“I’m a failure. No matter what I do or how hard I try, I’ll always be a failure.”</em></p><p id="""">Once I uncovered that story, it was a huge lightbulb moment. That led to the next step: <strong id="""">getting complete with the past</strong>. Because as I often say, <em id="""">we may be through with our past, but our past may not be through with us.</em></p><p id="""">What was happening was like tripping over the same chair I kept placing in front of myself.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Exactly. Most people don’t even recognize that themselves. That’s why mentors help so much. Okay, so you’re uncovering your story—keep going.</strong></p><p id="""">Getting complete with the past is a process. In my case, my seminar leader helped me unpack each meaning and story I had attached to those negative experiences. The truth is: what happened, happened. We can’t change the past. But if we keep operating as if those old meanings are still real, we render ourselves powerless.</p><p id="""">Getting complete means letting go of those old meanings—freeing yourself to start fresh.</p><p id="""">Then comes the final step: <strong id="""">inventing new possibilities.</strong></p><p id="""">We use the word <em id="""">invent</em> because we’re not talking about wishful thinking like “I want to be rich.” That comes from lack—from effect, not cause. Instead, we become the cause. That aligns with the natural law of <em id="""">be, do, have.</em></p><p id="""">Society often teaches the reverse—<em id="""">have, do, be</em>: “If I have money, then I can do what I want, and then I’ll be happy.” But the truth is the opposite. Be the person first. Do the work that person would do. Then, naturally, you’ll have what aligns with that identity.</p><p id="""">Look at innovators like Thomas Edison—he didn’t see his early failures as mistakes. He said, “I found a thousand ways not to make a light bulb.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. It sounds subtle, but it’s not. It makes a huge difference in your performance.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. When you <em id="""">become</em> the person first—embody that mindset—it dictates your actions and effectiveness. The results naturally follow. There’s no shortage of money in the world, only a shortage of ideas. If you want to elevate your wealth, elevate your thinking and your mindset.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I love that. So let me get this right—it’s uncover your story, get complete with your past, and invent new possibilities. And I like that it ties to identity, because most people operate from their past. But even in the present, it’s hard to do the things you want unless you first <em id="""">become</em> the person you want to be. When I give myself permission to be that person, I act differently. If you don’t feel you’re there yet, you hesitate. I’m sure a lot of this mindset work ties into consistency too.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Daily Rituals and Consistency</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Do you have particular daily rituals or protocols you use to stay consistent personally?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely. For those who haven’t read <em id="""">The Miracle Morning</em> by Hal Elrod, definitely read it. He even has an app called <em id="""">The Miracle Morning.</em> That’s what I use. It tracks what he calls the “SAVERS.” I won’t go into the whole acronym, but it’s a powerful morning framework that sets you up for success each day.</p><p id="""">Starting your morning that way elevates your mindset before you even begin your day.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I think winning the morning is key to winning the day. I’ve learned that too. And if you don’t create consistency, even after breakthrough moments, you can slip back into complacency or false productivity. Just being <em id="""">busy</em> isn’t the same as being <em id="""">productive.</em> That’s great advice, and that book suggestion is solid. I really appreciate you spending time here.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Final Thoughts and Contact Information</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You have a lot of ways to tie physical well-being to mental well-being. I’d love to have another conversation in the future, but what’s the best way for people to get in touch with you or connect?</strong></p><p id="""">First, LinkedIn. I’m pretty active there—you can find me by typing <em id="""">Charlie Chen</em> or <em id="""">LinkedIn.com/in/MrCharisma.</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Mr. Charisma, nice! What’s the story behind that?</strong></p><p id="""">Funny story—I was attending a Les Brown live event early in my personal development journey. At the end, I went to meet him. I was wearing a tan suit, and when I shook his hand, he said, “How you doing, Mr. Charisma?” It stuck ever since!</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s awesome—from the master himself! I’ve had Les speak for me many times, and I love that phrase: “You have greatness inside of you.” It sticks. You’ve got so many great things going on, Charlie. Before we wrap up, do you have any last bits of advice or strategies for our listeners?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. What I’d say is: find inner peace before trying to figure out what to do externally. The outside world reflects the inner world. If you don’t have it figured out inside, everything outside will feel chaotic.</p><p id="""">There’s something called SWOT analysis—Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Identify those first. Then, address them with the four languages of leadership: <strong id="""">vision casting, storytelling, assignments, and challenge.</strong></p><p id="""">Start with vision—cast that first. Then storytelling: uncover the story limiting you now, and invent the story you want to tell the world. Next, assignments—give yourself action steps to pursue opportunities. Lastly, challenge yourself to face threats head-on.</p><p id="""">Because what you resist, persists. The more you avoid it, the more it controls you. Face your weaknesses, and turn them into your strengths.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, that’s great advice. Most of our listeners are leaders, and that’s exactly what they need to be hearing. This has been an amazing conversation, Charlie. For everyone listening, I’ll put the links to connect with Charlie in the show notes. I encourage you to reach out.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">One thing I always say—no matter where you are or what you’re doing—it’s never too late to start living the life you’re meant to live. Sometimes it’s just one connection away. One strategy away. One decision away.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Charlie, thank you again for joining us, and to our listeners, we appreciate you tuning in.

We're joined today by an awesome CEO. I've had a chance to get to meet him, Jack Espy, and he's the CEO of Spirited Hive. We're going to talk about some things because I really wanted to have him on the show because I was excited about how he put his vision into reality and then also talk about some leadership things and stuff.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, Jack, welcome to the show, man.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, thank you so much for having me on. Excited to be here.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, this is great because I think a lot of people sometimes that I interview have these big success stories, and people think, ""Oh man, where did they start? Where are they coming from?"" And you really have been able to create something amazing in the last little while. It's like the perfect entrepreneurial story of having an idea in a really rough, difficult time—the pandemic—and pulling something to action.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Birth of Spirited Hive</strong></h3><p id="""">So the whole idea started at the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p id="""">So I was actually in college. I was at USC in LA, and my whole background was real estate finance, real estate development. I graduated in 2020, so straight into the pandemic. I was supposed to accept a job in capital markets in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, that job fell through because it was right at the beginning, and they were like, ""Hey, look, we're not hiring anyone right now."" I totally understood. Nonetheless, that left me jobless right out of college.</p><p id="""">Like everyone else at this point in time, I was at home mixing up one too many quarantine cocktails. I was making two drinks for my buddies, which were my two favorite drinks: Moscow Mules and Mexican Mules—or they were at the time. I was making these drinks for all my friends during the pandemic, and they were like, ""Jack, these drinks are really good. You should can them.""</p><p id="""">That was right at the beginning of the whole canned cocktail boom. There was pretty much a new canned cocktail coming out every single week. I'm sitting there thinking, ""I've got nothing else better going on. Why not? It would be cool to create my own brand."" At this point in time, no one knew how long the pandemic was really going to last. I thought, ""This would be fun to pass the time, and once COVID is over, I'll go back to real estate finance. It would just be a fun kind of thing to do—a passion project.""</p><p id="""">We were all sitting there thinking about different names for this brand. I said, ""Wait, guys, what about the name Mint Bee?"" They were like, ""First of all, that's the stupidest name I've ever heard of, but why Mint Bee?"" I was like, ""Oh, because there's mint in a Moscow Mule and bee because they're both sweetened with honey.""</p><p id="""">They were like, ""Dude, what are you talking about? There's no honey in either of those drinks.""</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I was just going to say, I don’t get that, so you’re catching me there.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, so it's funny because I'm not a mixologist. It's funny now because everyone's like, ""Oh, you created this canned cocktail. You must be a mixologist."" I'm like, ""No, I just fell into this."" I never knew that there wasn’t honey in a Moscow Mule.</p><p id="""">So I'm sitting there with my buddies, and I'm like, ""What if I took a different approach to this whole canned cocktail category and made a better-for-you canned cocktail that was only sweetened with honey—no cane sugar, no sucralose, no artificial sugars at all, just sweetened with honey?"" I don’t know; I'm really big into health and fitness. I really care about achieving my goals in the gym, but I also don’t like waking up and feeling crappy in the morning after having a couple of drinks. A lot of that comes from sugar and the ingredients that are used.</p><p id="""">So I thought, ""I want to take a different approach and create a better-for-you canned cocktail."" That’s what sparked this whole idea for Hive.</p><p id="""">We went down the road of creating one that was our tequila—our take on a Mexican Mule—and then I was bringing that to parties during the pandemic. My friends who were girls were like, “Hey, I love this idea, but does it work with vodka?” So I made one with vodka. Then my bourbon-loving buddies were like, “Hey, does it work with bourbon?” And then a gin.</p><p id="""">It became a culmination of this whole idea of ""Who’s your hive? Who’s your community? Who are the people that you love to spend time with?"" Toast to a life that is sweet with your hive.</p><p id="""">Not everyone in your hive likes tequila; they might like bourbon, gin, or vodka. But now we have all the alcohol bases, so anyone in your hive—if they like the idea of a better-for-you canned cocktail—we have one for them.</p><p id="""">That was all teased out, and then it took me about two years to get the product to market. I was very naive to this industry. It took me about two years, and we launched in May of 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. So we’ve been in the market for just about two years now.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Challenges and Lessons Learned</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow, man. Guys, listen, there are so many freaking lessons in what he just said, and we’re going to break them down. First of all, congrats. That’s a great story, and you’ve really been able to bring your vision to reality, which is great. I always tell people when they’re getting started—because they try to figure everything out ahead of time—that some of the most successful entrepreneurs I know (you’re definitely included in that) just have an idea, say yes, and then figure it out.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Not only did you figure it out as you went along, but it sounds like the idea developed as you went along. In other words, you were starting with the idea and moving down the road when you perfected the name, the other products, and everything else. What do you say to people that generally think, ""I have an idea, but I don’t really know""? You went out and got the feedback you needed to move forward. Is that something you thought about, or did you just start doing it, and it all came together?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. I literally just started doing it. It was interesting because I was asked on a podcast not too long ago what the scariest part was at that point. The scariest part was actually when we got recognition, and people were like, “Yeah, this is great. Let’s get this thing going.”</p><p id="""">Then I thought, ""Wow, this is legit,"" because for so long during the pandemic, I didn’t really know what was going on. I had this idea; I was going for it. I was working with a formulator, producing it on a small scale, and got a distributor. Very cool—I can sell into retail.</p><p id="""">Then people were actually buying it, and we sold out. I thought, ""Oh, wait. This is scary now. This is real. This is legit. This is a full-time company that I have to give my all to.""</p><p id="""">For anyone out there who has an idea they’re passionate about, that’s the biggest thing. If you have an idea you’re passionate about, you don’t need to have everything figured out.</p><p id="""">So many people will tell you differently, but I didn’t. It’s something that you can learn as you go. You also figure things out as you go.</p><p id="""">We didn’t have this whole idea of the hive community until months—almost probably a year—down the road. That’s a big thing behind our marketing. A lot of that gets teased out as you develop the brand.</p><p id="""">You don’t need to have everything figured out to launch a company. I think the biggest thing—and the biggest hurdle—that it takes for a lot of entrepreneurs is they think they have to have everything figured out before they can start, and that’s just not the case, I don’t think.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. You definitely had two ingredients that I think are very common to people who really follow. You said it: Number one, if it’s something you’re passionate about—if not, you’re constantly thinking, ""Man, is this going to work or not?"" Having the passion is key. Your company has done a phenomenal job of adding the people part—meaning if you’re passionate about something, that’s great, but if you also have the right people around you, it helps you stay focused. Both of those are very key principles, and you’re a great example of that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me ask you this: When you started, you said, ""I was going down finance. I’m in college. I graduated and lost my job."" Obviously, great that you overcame that. You said a comment: ""As I was going, I knew I could always go back to real estate."" So you probably started the company with the idea that you had a backup. At what point do you feel like that changed, where you thought, ""I’m not interested in the backup,"" or, ""I’m all in""?</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I find that a common element with entrepreneurs who really create success like you have. There’s a point where you just go all in, and there isn’t really a backup anymore. What point was that for you?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. It was actually... I think a lot of people have that idea of maybe having a backup, but it wasn’t a defined moment in time. This was for me.</p><p id="""">I didn’t say this, but I was at NYU. I graduated from USC, lost the job I was supposed to get. While I came up with this idea, I was also at NYU getting my master’s in real estate finance, which was completely online. So I was doing that master’s program, really wanting, like I was saying, to be in finance and real estate finance, while coming up with the idea for Hive and doing both.</p><p id="""">It got to the point where I was missing homework assignments with NYU, and I was missing deadlines I put in place for myself with Hive because I was juggling too many things.</p><p id="""">I literally had a moment in time where I thought, ""I need to just focus on Hive completely. I can’t be doing both these things.""</p><p id="""">It really came down to the idea that NYU grad school will always be around—it’s never going away. I can always come back to that whenever I want, whereas Hive is a specific moment in time. This industry is moving so quickly, and it’s becoming so saturated that I only have a finite amount of time to actually give it my all, get after it, and go for it.</p><p id="""">It was very scary. I remember talking to my parents about it. My stepdad is a founder of a company, and he understands, but he was also like, “No, you’re not doing this. You have to focus on school. You have to finish what you started.”</p><p id="""">I’m a big proponent of finishing what I’ve started, but I said, “No, I’m doing it. I’m going after this dream that I have, and I’m going to chase it.”</p><p id="""">It was super scary because there was no safety net at that point in time. It was like, ""Wow, this is legit."" When we sold out for the first time and people loved the brand, it was that ""Oh, wow"" moment—like, this is real.</p><p id="""">It’s really cool to see that if I had made a different decision, my life would have been completely different, and I would have always been kicking myself thinking, ""I wish I had gone after the idea.""</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. I’m curious because I do feel like there are multiple points of inflection for a really successful entrepreneur. One is, you said, ""I’m going to do this,"" and you just started going. You had it around your purpose and passion and figured it out. But then there’s that point of, ""Alright, I’ve got to go all in."" When you made that decision... Those are the hard decisions for most because even a great idea is going nowhere unless you go all in. What do you think was the real difference-maker for you? Was it that you talked with your parents? Did you feel... because I feel like sometimes people feel like they’re forced into it. You had enough opportunity; you just had to. Or was it that you had some good support network? What really helped you to kick over that edge of, ""I’m in""? Or was it just a combination of all those things?</strong></p><p id="""">I think it’s a combination of a lot of those things, but also my passion behind it. Something really drove me to say, ""Hey, I love this idea. I love the product. I love the vision I have for this.""</p><p id="""">It was right at the beginning, right at the start, and I saw this vision of what it could be. That first step over the starting line was, ""Let’s go see. Let’s go see what it is."" This is a fleeting moment in time. Especially because I was so young, it was really scary.</p><p id="""">I think the scariest part of that hesitation was that I had never worked for someone ever before in my entire life. I knew nothing about the industry. I had to learn so much, and I was very naive. But all those things are a culmination of creating great success too because, for me, I thought, “What’s the worst that can happen?” The worst thing I could do was fail. So I thought, “Just go and see.”</p><p id="""">Making that first jump was a scary jump. It involved a lot of learning along the way in an industry that’s probably one of the most difficult, most complex, and most saturated industries in the world. You learn as you go.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. It’s a testament to the fact that you figure out all those details. I think that common denominator—something you’re passionate about and also something you love—because if you think about the people, the health, the fitness, all those components just make it easier for you to move forward.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So you’ve had probably a million different challenges along the way, and you’re still growing. Did you have a point in time where you had, or maybe a specific example of, a moment when you questioned whether you should keep doing this? Or you had to really overcome something where you thought, “Bro, I don’t know what I’m doing. This is not going to go the direction I want unless I get some help”? Were there any of those kinds of moments where you were pretty much questioning whether you were going forward or not?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. For any entrepreneur or founder out there listening to this, they’re probably laughing because those speed bumps in the road—at the beginning—may feel like massive potholes. It’s, “Oh my gosh, I just totaled the car. I don’t know if I can do this anymore.”</p><p id="""">But five, ten years down the road, it’s, “Oh yeah, that was like a pebble in the road. That was nothing.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The bigger you are, the bigger the problems you have.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s just another chink in the armor. It’s, “Okay, whatever. Brush it off the shoulder, keep going.”</p><p id="""">But I remember the first one that I ever had. We were taking our stab at a variety pack. The industry is very seasonal. For spring and summer, that’s when we sell the product like crazy, and then it falls off in the fall and winter because not that many people are drinking cocktails.</p><p id="""">We were a little bit behind the gun on getting a variety pack done for summer, so we were pushing it pretty quickly to market. That was something we shouldn’t have done. We should have pumped the brakes and waited for the next summer because it was way too quick to get that to market.</p><p id="""">We pushed the designs, pushed everything, got it done, and sent the carton off to be printed.</p><p id="""">I remember vividly, I was flying back on a red-eye from a USC tailgate with all my fraternity brothers. I wasn’t feeling that great the next morning on that red-eye back to New York. I landed in New York and got a call from my designer. He goes, “Hey, we just printed 35,000 cartons of the variety pack.”</p><p id="""">I was like, “Yes! Let’s go.”</p><p id="""">He said, “There’s a small issue.”</p><p id="""">I said, “What’s the issue?”</p><p id="""">He goes, “There’s a typo.”</p><p id="""">I was like, “Wait, hold on.” There I am, on the plane, just landed, tired, hungover, out of it. I’m like, “Wait, what do you mean there’s a typo?”</p><p id="""">He goes, “Yeah, we spelled ‘tequila’ without the ‘i.’” So it was spelled “teqila.”</p><p id="""">My mind is just racing. For us, that was a lot of money at the time—so much money. At the end of the day, the buck stops with me. That was my mistake. Yes, we’re paying people to make all those edits and decisions to ensure everything is revised and done, but at the end of the day, everything stops with me as the leader of the company.</p><p id="""">I thought, “Okay, what can we do to figure this out?” I spent multiple days thinking, “I don’t know if we’re going to come back from this. I don’t know what to do.”</p><p id="""">We just figured it out. We ended up using them as gift boxes to send to influencers. It worked out great because it was a perfect way to send something to an influencer, with all our flavors right there. It worked, and we were fine.</p><p id="""">Yes, we took a hit on it a little bit. We’ve had so many other, much bigger speed bumps in the road since then. That one feels so small now.</p><p id="""">You figure it out. You learn as you go. We’re not perfect. We learn from our failures. Now, I personally look at everything—every single word on any can, point-of-sale material, all of it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Man, I tell you, that is such a great story. I’m sure you’ve been able to use that because it goes straight to the point of so many things. Success leaves clues. Failure is a gateway to success. Now it’s going to help you do more. You took responsibility as a leader, which I think probably inspired your team as well because it would have been very easy to blame someone else for that. Yet, you found a solution and moved forward.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. Entrepreneurs’ journeys are riddled with dozens of those examples. Looking back, most would see bad experiences, but you’re stacking those up as things that help you move forward into other areas. That’s awesome.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Community</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Your company is based really heavily around this idea of community. Why do you—in addition to fitness and things like this—focus so much on community? Why is that so important, do you feel, to your company and maybe even to most companies? How do you distinguish between community and culture? Or is it the same thing for you? Talk to me about your thoughts around community and why it’s such a big deal for Spirited Hive.</strong></p><p id="""">Totally. This company was really built off community. That first night I was making drinks with my buddies, it was built for friends, with friends. I wouldn’t have had this company if it wasn’t for my buddies during the pandemic, just mixing up these cocktails.</p><p id="""">The funny thing is that I was never meant to be behind the bar making cocktails. I was just the least lazy one out of my friends to do it. If I hadn’t been with my friends, I wouldn’t have created this company.</p><p id="""">So this company is all derived around community. It’s something I think is so precious in life—creating those connections with people. At the end of the day, drinking is an occasion that brings people together. I think everything in moderation is great. If you’re drinking safely with your friends, that brings people together and creates connections.</p><p id="""">Something we’re doing that’s big behind this program—or the company—is our ambassador program. That’s something we’re really trying to hit home in all the markets we’re selling in.</p><p id="""">This ambassador program includes multiple influencers in different states, and they bring people together through activations or events. It’s not just for people to try Hive but to bring people together around the idea of “Who’s your hive? Who’s your community? Who are the people you love to spend time with?”</p><p id="""">A lot of that has to do with working out or events. We do events usually on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday nights—like a Barry’s class, a GoRuck event, a run class, or something like that.</p><p id="""">Something I like to call “type two fun,” which is my favorite type of fun. It’s the kind of fun where you’re like, “Oh, this sucks,” but afterward, you think, “That was a great workout.” When you get to enjoy it with your friends, it makes it even better. Type two fun is never as much fun unless you’re with your friends.</p><p id="""">Then we enjoy a couple of Hives afterward, toast to a life that is sweet, and all of those kinds of things.</p><p id="""">Community is such a big pillar of this company. I think a lot of these brands aren’t focusing on bringing people together. It means so much more when you’re spending time with your friends.</p><p id="""">Developing this company during COVID—when a lot of people weren’t spending time together—highlighted that. Once we launched right after COVID, people loved that we were bringing people back together and creating that sense of community. That’s something that means so much to me and to Spirited Hive.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, man, I love it. Your success really does give some great ideas for people out there. I loved your idea of “type two fun”—combining stuff that sucks, that you don’t want to do, with friends and lifestyle. It reminds me also of what I find really good, successful companies have: People chasing success right now but doing it for lifestyle. If you can have both—which I believe you can—you create the things and the emotions that bring fulfillment.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The whole reason I started The Daily Mastermind is this concept of the mastermind, which is two or more people coming together in the spirit of harmony to create an end goal. Much like the hive, right? The hive works together—“Who’s your hive?” So I really love that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think people need to realize that a lot of people in success, entrepreneurs, look for strategies and techniques, but sometimes the underlying message—like you’re saying, community, friendship—really is the secret sauce that helps people move forward with the strategies they’re trying to use. I’m going to really recommend that if you’re listening to this, you follow Jack and find out more. Read between the lines because the way you’re structuring your company and the mission and purpose you have is more than just a success story.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You started your business in one of the most difficult times you could—a global pandemic. What advice would you give in today’s market? It’s very competitive. If someone is looking to get their idea out there or grow to the next level, do you have anything you would recommend to young entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs that are growing? How can they get the courage to take their business to fruition or their ideas to the next level? What’s some practical advice you’d give today?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. Something that’s been so successful for us is developing your brand—making it very easy for people to follow and creating a story brand that tells a story.</p><p id="""">Consumers love to invest in products that are not only good and have good packaging but also have a brand with a story behind it—a real meaning.</p><p id="""">For us, it’s obviously community, but also the founder’s story of how it came to be. It’s very organic and easy. I’m not saying you should fabricate something like that, but put time, effort, and thought into how this idea, brand, or vision differs from another brand or vision. How does it make you unique?</p><p id="""">Then figure out how to develop a story around that or bring that story to life for the consumer to understand and buy into.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I think that’s a great recommendation because I see that myself in the marketplace. Really, your unique selling proposition nowadays needs to be your brand and story. It’s not just about features and benefits. You could be heavily promoting all-natural ingredients and honey—and not that you don’t—but your brand, story, community, and people really make the brand. That’s what separates you. All the other things layer in. That’s great advice, man. I love that advice.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Where can people follow you? Where can they connect with you? I’ll put links in the show notes, but where’s the best place for them to connect with you?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. If you want to reach out to me, I’m very active on social.

And I'm joined with an amazing guest like you.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You guys are gonna just be blown away. You're gonna be so happy. Terry Rich, welcome to the podcast.</strong></p><p id="""">Thank you very much. You're setting the bar pretty high here, George.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oh no, I haven't even begun, man. Oh, okay. You gotta sit back for a minute, guys. Listen to me. I had a little short introduction for Terry, but I gotta read you some of this guy's background.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It's definitely going to inspire you, but I love how you described Terry as creative, lucky, energetic, and fraud-busting. That is just like a taste of what we're talking about here. But at the end of the day, Terry is a keynote speaker and author. A panelist, been on the Tonight Show, giving away a billion dollars, cracked the largest US lottery fraud ever.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">This guy runs four completely separate businesses. He's a great speaker, great innovator. I love the idea of innovation, by the way. Terry, like there’s so much stuff to unpack in the limited time we have. I almost don't even know where to start.</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, I'll follow you. I'll follow you, George.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. I love it. Tell me this. How did you do it, because we can fast forward to the lottery here in a second. We got some ideas. You guys are just not gonna wanna leave for a second.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Terry Rich's Background and Early Career</strong></h3><p id="""">But give us some of your background, give us a little bit of the lay of the land, where you've come from and how you got into this. Because even with all that intro, I know you're a marketer. I know you're a promoter, you're a speaker. Tell us just a little bit about your background. Lay the backdrop for us here.</p><p id="""">Sure. I fell into it. Hey, I grew up on a farm in Iowa, a little dinky town in Iowa, a town of 50. I went to school, going to be a math major or a physics professor, and some guy said, “Hey, you can go over here and make a talk and make a living.” I thought, “I'm in.” So I got into TV and radio and all my buddies went into broadcast television, and I was dumb enough to say I waited too long to send out a resume. So somebody called and said, “Hey, they need somebody to help with the cable television that's being built, brand new, just starting.”</p><p id="""">Okay. They said they couldn't pay me much, but they gave me these things called stock options. Lo and behold, it was the greatest growth opportunity, just like somebody getting into Google for the first time. I got to work with Ted Turners and helped create MTV and CNN and all of those, traveled the country..</p><p id="""">And we built this cable system bigger and bigger. And in that, I learned a lot about innovation and entrepreneurship. 'Cause we couldn't touch anything that didn't seem to turn to gold. Everybody wanted cable television because it was the new up-and-coming thing with all these new networks.</p><p id="""">And my dad once told me, he said, “Hey, work hard for someone, which is what I was doing. Yeah. And make a living, do a good job. When you turn 62, you're gonna get your social security and you're gonna be happy.” At age 40, we cashed it out. Somebody took a run at our stock, and lo and behold, we cashed out and I now had the money I thought I ever needed in life. And I thought, happiness doesn't happen when you make a goal. Happiness happens on the way to success. All of the excitement of having and starting new companies really got me going. So then I started my own companies.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Entrepreneurial Ventures and Lessons Learned</strong></h3><p id="""">And during the cable years, although I failed a few times, I learned about doing satellite uplinks. And so I was doing these free previews. You'd turn on, “Hey Marge, we're showing free HBO.” We'd get on and say, “Hey, now's the time to call in between the movies and call us now.” And the first one we did sold $15 million. It was kinda like mixing infomercials with C-Span, long-form programming that we used the cable networks for, and then we'd get on and sell it.</p><p id="""">So I had my own company doing those, and on the side, we started two or three other companies. Bought and sold a radio station. Started when we had the MPEG-1 transfer business and those sorts of things. But at age 50, you know what happened, George?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What's that?</strong></p><p id="""">Midlife crisis.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oh wow.</strong></p><p id="""">And at that point, I said, “I want to get off the road. I wanna be with my family. I've made the money,” and I got a call. Someone said, “Hey, they're about ready to close the zoo. Would you be interested in running the zoo?” I told you I was on the farm. I thought, “If I could be a farmer, I sure as heck could take care of giraffes too.” So we turned a zoo that was losing $600,000 a year, turned it around. Got a lot of people in marketing, promotion, doing basic business blocking and tackling. And ultimately, I got a $15 million endowment. So it's gonna be around forever. Built it to the second-largest cultural attraction in the state.</p><p id="""">Then I got a call from the governor who said, “Hey, we need someone to run the lottery.”</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Lottery Career and Major Fraud Case</strong></h3><p id="""">A guy retired. Never really done that either, so I got into it. And as you heard, gave away a billion dollars over the 10 years I was there. But in the middle of it, had a vendor who tried to steal from everyone. It took us seven years, but we cracked the largest lottery fraud in US history.</p><p id="""">So today I travel the world telling people the story—how it happened and why—and how you want to protect yourself internally so you don't have internal fraud. Don't go through what I went through. So that's my history. That's my deal.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. You bridged over a lot of really cool stuff, which we are gonna try to unpack for a sec.</strong></p><p id="""">I'll let you lead, I'll follow.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You know what's funny? I gotta tell you, Terry, you made a couple of comments and I always tell people that listen to the show, success leaves clues, and there are common traits of successful and happy and fulfilled people. And you said 'em almost like they were just second nature, but I know that they're probably through long lessons. But you said things like happiness is found along the way and things like that. I think a lot of people don't realize that until later in life. But I wanna back you up because I do agree with what you said.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Insights on Failure and Success</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It seems to me that you've done some pretty random stuff, but you've really done things that when you talk about 'em, they sound like things you love and enjoy. Do you think a secret or a key to your success is that you were doing things you love, or were you just following the paths that weren't necessarily things you were passionate about, but you turned them into that? Because going from business to fraud to cable to all those different things, it seems like it was almost kind of happenstance to a degree. Or was it that you were following paths that you were good at? Help me understand a little bit.</strong></p><p id="""">Looking back now, I think I'd give some pieces of advice about what happened to me that I would suggest. First, I always raised my hand. If the boss came in and said, “Hey, the toilets need cleaning, the janitor's gone,” I’d be the first to raise my hand. Because you become noticed if you just volunteer. Do things you've never done before, and you're gonna learn some new things.</p><p id="""">The second is failure is the first step to success. I failed many times. In fact, the first time I failed, I got into the cable business. I was on camera, I was doing a TV show, and I looked out, and I didn't have any of the five o'clock shadow—and this five o'clock. So I wrote to Gillette and said, “Hey, I love your razor, and if you'd like me to come out and be on TV, I'd love to do that.” So I wrote 'em a letter, sent it to New York, thinking in two weeks they'd call me and I'd be on national television. And during those two weeks, probably like you feel when you play Powerball or Mega Millions, I thought, “What if it happened?” Yeah. It's better to have tried and failed than to succeed at doing nothing. That was my old college professor: “Try something new.”</p><p id="""">So I got the letter in two weeks and I had this excitement about being on national television. It said, “Dear Mr. Rich, we're glad you liked the razor, but you wrote the wrong company. Gillette makes that. Here's their address.” So I failed that, but that excitement got me going just a few years later when I did a promotion out of the blue. Tried something no one else had tried, and that was to get people in for a centennial that only had 50 people living in the town. We did a hundred-year centennial and tried to adopt a national celebrity, and ultimately landed on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show.</p><p id="""">I wrote 44 letters. Only one person responded. When we wrote 44 letters or press releases, yeah, only one press person called. I failed 43 times. But that one person was from United Press International. They threw it on the national scope, and with all the publicity we got, we had ABC, NBC, CBS, Today Show, Good Morning America—all in this little town of 50 people. And 12,500 people showed up.</p><p id="""">But that isn't the secret there. The secret was I failed. But I learned during that, the Carson show talked about uplinking via satellite, which had never been done in our state. And remember, I was in the cable business at this time. So I thought, why couldn't I do these free previews? And so I called around, and they said, “Yeah, we can get you a satellite uplink. When do you want it?” And the first weekend, as I told you, we did $15 million in net worth for the company.</p><p id="""">All because I failed 43 of the 44 times.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. So I love your perspective and your message on failure because I think a lot of people, as entrepreneurs, they hear, “You’ve gotta fail. It’s the gateway to success, it’s the price you pay for success.” But it seems to me—and I’ve heard this from a few real high-end CEOs—that it’s also your perspective on failure. People that don’t view failure as a bad thing that you gotta go through to be successful. You seem to have this perspective that failure is really an opportunity for success. It’s just the way you phrase it. To me, it makes me feel like your perspective on failure is not the struggle you gotta go through, but literally the opportunities you go through to get to success. Would you say that’s a good description?</strong></p><p id="""">I think that’s a great way to say it. In fact, if you haven’t failed, you haven’t pushed the envelope far enough. You’re not going after the entire market. Think about when we sent three people to the moon. Project managers are notorious. When I was a CEO, you’d have a project manager saying, “Here’s the date, here’s our program, here’s our goal.” And then they fail once and they quit. “Oh, sorry, it ain’t gonna work.”</p><p id="""">We failed over 90% of the time when we sent three men to the moon. When they said, “10, 9, 8, 7…” they didn’t say, “Okay, we’ll talk to you in two weeks. It’s all planned out.” They said, “Oh my God, it’s going the wrong way. We gotta course correct.” Over 90% of the time. And how many times have you tried that one idea you think’s a million-dollar idea, and some little thing didn’t go quite right, so you quit? You can’t. That failure is the first step to success.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. It was. You find ways to make it work.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I was gonna say, not just the first step, but you also said something else, which I thought was key. You said, “Do something you’ve never done.” Meaning people try, and they do things they wanna do, and they do things they’re comfortable with, and they fail their way in things. But it seems to me your track record is a great path that shows you gotta do things you’ve never done. Because there are entrepreneurs that don’t know what they wanna do, and then there are entrepreneurs that are stuck in the rhythm or rut of what they do. But if you don’t try things you’ve never done before, first of all, you have to be willing to fail to do that, right? But trying things you’ve never done—man, you’ve got some great examples of that.</strong></p><p id="""">And you gotta accept change. Most people say, “Hey, it’s been working. Why do we need to change?” Think about taxi drivers who thought there would never be anything called Uber in the day. You gotta realize that things change, and you’ve gotta be part of that change.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s what boils down to the book that I wrote called <em id="""">Dare to Dream and Then Dare to Create.</em> I separated. I figured out that if I separate the creative portion of coming up with a hundred new ideas—and I’ve already tried to throw in 50-some—one of those might stick. And then you separate that from action. So you get everybody together, get a hundred ideas. And any idea is a good idea. You get rid of the “no mans,” the people who say, ‘No, man, that’ll never work.’ And you write down a hundred ideas. And then you put them away. You don’t judge them.</strong></p><p id="""">When you come back, though, you let the lawyers and the accountants and everybody in a meeting. And again, when you create a new idea, you want as diverse a look as possible. If everybody looks like you or me now, we aren’t gonna get the best idea, 'cause we’re in a global society now, a very diverse society.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">You wanna make as much money as you can, so you wanna get all the ideas. And once you have those ideas, you bring in the “no mans” back in, and they help everybody as a team. Then find the top three ideas, and now you’ve got the whole team supporting it because of that. It’s not just one idea.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. Yeah. That one didn’t work. So I love that.</strong></p><p id="""">I’m not very creative.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">No, but you know what? I just love the way you put things, and it’s both from a frame of reference of experience but also opportunity and openness. Because you have so many things going on. But being open, being willing to fail, knowing that you’ve gotta do things that are new.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So let me ask you this, because I wanna dig for a second into this lottery concept—this whole idea.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The $80 Billion Lottery Fraud Story</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve got that book, <em id="""">The $80 Billion Gamble,</em> right? <em id="""">True Crime Story of the Largest Lottery Fraud in US History.</em> Can you give us just a quick—by the way, when you tell your story, it all just sounds like this amazing, coasting-up-into-the-right chart of growth. I’m sure you had a lot of ups and downs, but can you tell this win of identifying a lottery fraud? What was going on at that time? Tell me a little bit about that.</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. I took the lottery job. You come in, you get all excited. “Hey, let’s paint the wall green, let’s put animals on the lottery,” all these different things that are going on. And all of a sudden, one day, I get a call. They say, “Hey, something’s scurry here.” I was actually on a cruise ship. I’m on vacation. They said, “Someone just called in. We had a lottery ticket worth $16.5 million. It was a multi-state game—we had about 18 states. It’s kinda like a mini Powerball so that we could have bigger jackpots.” And they said, “Hey, we had a winner on this jackpot, and no one showed up.”</p><p id="""">And so that’s logical—you’re getting your accountant, you’re getting your… big deal. So we kept saying, “Hey, look for this ticket, it could be yours.” Then we started getting the cranks—cranky people who said, “Hey, I think the clerk stole it.” Or someone called and said, “My husband, I think he’s in the mafia because he drives the truck, and I haven’t seen him for six months. He comes in—half of that money is mine.” Those kinds of things.</p><p id="""">But we got a call from a lawyer in Canada who said, “I have the ticket, and here are the serial numbers.” And no one else could tell you the serial numbers, 'cause only the person with the ticket had it.</p><p id="""">It clicked. And so the person who had our frontline employee in the culture that we had—all of a sudden something didn’t sound right. Because he said, “I’m gonna send you the ticket, you send me the $16.5 million.”</p><p id="""">Ding, ding. She said she sent it up to our security and our public relations folks, and they started asking questions. And they said, “What were you wearing?” Obviously, when you buy a lottery ticket, you’re on camera in a C-store.</p><p id="""">He said, “I wore this tweed shirt.” No. The picture we had was of a 300-400 pound guy with a black hoodie. And we said, “No, that didn’t…” And our security guy said, “The guy just created frauds. We’re calling in the Department of Criminal Investigation.”</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Cracking the Lottery Fraud Case</strong></h3><p id="""">This is a lot of money. It’s big. We’re trying to figure it out. Make a long story short—when it’s all said and done, three years later, we talk about the ticket itself. We had to investigate where it was bought. We figured out who had the ticket. It went through three different lawyers from Canada to New York and back down to Texas.</p><p id="""">The client? We couldn’t figure out how that person would know anybody or why he—why that person just wouldn’t come in. And we ultimately released the video of the guy buying the ticket, and someone said, “Wait a minute, that is Eddie Tipton.”</p><p id="""">Eddie Tipton was the security officer for the Multi-State Lottery Association who wrote the code, compiled the code, and oversaw the drawings of this Hot Lotto jackpot drawing.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">No coincidence there.</strong></p><p id="""">And we couldn’t figure out how he was associated with the guy in Texas, but we connected the two because they were on—here’s one lesson—if you’re gonna do something illegal, don’t use social media. One was the CEO of the other’s IT company in Texas. And so we connected them and ultimately busted him. And he received up to 25 years in prison.</p><p id="""">The crazy part was, he bought two hot dogs when he bought the ticket. And you know what? His—he brought his brother up when he was found guilty to testify and say how Eddie was a great guy. But he said, “That ain’t my brother. My brother don’t eat hot dogs.”</p><p id="""">And… The Associated Press picked up that quote and put it on the national wires. And a guy in Texas said, “Wait a minute. I think that’s a guy who was investigated for money laundering.” So they said, “Check his brother too.” And all of a sudden, we busted five jackpots across the United States.</p><p id="""">Eddie had put out up to 50 of these computers to draw state lottery drawings along with this national one that we had. Now this isn’t Powerball or Mega Millions because they’re drawn with the balls. These were computer-drawn games.</p><p id="""">So long story short, we busted it. I learned some simple lessons in life. If you want to know if somebody can steal within your—get a good employee.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Understanding Fraud: The Three Key Elements</strong></h3><p id="""">If usually—point number one, according to the Certified Fraud Examiners—is you want more money. You, George, you and I want to always make more money.</p><p id="""">But this is where you go through a divorce, you’ve got gambling problems, you’re drinking too much, or you’re on drugs. Then you say, “I gotta have more money.” You bust.</p><p id="""">The second is opportunity. Think about a church where the church secretary, Aunt Wilma, takes in the money and also writes the checks and also writes the purchase orders. You’re probably ripe for fraud. That's an opportunity.</p><p id="""">And the final one is rational. At some point, when do you say—and this is what Eddie said when we got him, and he did a proffer afterwards that said, “George, I was working really hard, and whoever over here was making more money, I deserved it.”</p><p id="""">Put those all three together. You’re ripe for fraud. So that’s kind of the story I tell when I go out on the road.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love though that you learn lessons from all these things, whether it’s just something that happens or not. And I think that integrity and ethics and things like that are a big thing in business right now because so many people don’t know what to believe. They don’t know what to see there. But there are some simple principles like you just mentioned. So I really like that. I think that’s a really good thing.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Creating an Environment of Innovation</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Another thing though, that I just bring it back a little bit to the business end, the thing I noticed about what you said is creating this environment of innovation. This is something that you and I kinda mentioned earlier that I think you’ve learned those lessons because you’ve always been thinking outta the box. You’ve always been doing other things. What are some ways for businesses, based on lessons you’ve learned, that they can create an environment of innovation? People doing things that they don’t normally do, thinking outta the box, because that’s something that I think is really important to business right now.</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. What are some things you can speak to there, big or small? The big companies often do this—research and development, they call it. But in a smaller company, I suggest that whenever you make money—you can’t really do this coming outta college. You don’t wanna bet the whole farm and then lose it all on your first idea. So when you start making money, I tell people, “Go to work for someone and then start a company at night and weekends until you get the cash flow going to start it.”</p><p id="""">But once you start making good money, take a portion of that and make it your R&amp;D fund. You could call it gambling, your research and development, to do the craziest ideas that you can do. And in doing that, you keep growing, always trying to innovate and always change. Back to the idea of how taxis not still relevant today when Uber came along?</p><p id="""">So take a piece of that money and put it to the side. I think that’s probably the big one. The other is creating new ideas. We came up with an idea in the lottery. Because it’s a state organization, we all think government employees don’t want to change anything, right? So first thing I go in, “Let’s do this, let’s do that,” and everybody’s going, “Oh my God, that’s too much. We can’t do it.”</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Implementing the COT System for Better Communication</strong></h3><p id="""">And I said, “No, I’m just trying to give you an idea.” I didn’t realize that when you’re the king—if you’re the king and you say, “Oh, poop,” everybody heads for the bathroom because employees wanna please the boss, right? So we came up with an idea called COT—C.O.T.—and the idea is so they understand when I really want something done. When you do an email or I’m talking to you face-to-face, if I say “Action required,” which I do maybe one to two percent, that means, yeah, it’s job-changing. You better do it, or you could get fired.</p><p id="""">The second is F.Y.I.—for your information. I want you to read it. I want you to know it. But we may not talk about it for a while. But the third one is what I use the most—it’s called C.O.T. If I say C.O.T., it means “Consider or throw away.” And there are rules to that when you use this in your organization.</p><p id="""">The rules are, if I say “Consider or throw away” in an email, you can hit delete. You don’t even have to read it. I just wanted to get the idea off my chest. And I don’t want you to write back, “Oh, great idea, boss.” No. I just want to give you the idea.</p><p id="""">What we found right away is the employees now lifted the pressure because they knew what I really wanted and what I was trying to get as an idea. And then they passed it on to their employees. And the beauty of that is many people have suggestion boxes. But if the receptionist has a really good idea that she wants, she’s afraid to tell anybody. She doesn’t wanna be fired for a dumb idea. So she puts it in the suggestion box, and then it may not get read for two or three weeks. And by the time it goes around, she’s in the breakroom saying, “Management never listens to this. I put something in.”</p><p id="""">Now she or he can send that idea, put C.O.T., and know that it went out and got a chance to give it. And it creates a whole different innovative environment to try to get all these ideas together. And then again, put ‘em to the side until you have the group to say, “Now, let’s act. What’s our priorities? What sounds like something we should do?”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think it gives permission, like you said, because what I love about that, ‘cause I’ve had a lot of experience with that over the years, is that if you’re a boss or you’re running a business or you’re a CEO, C-level executive, and you have an idea that you wanna bounce off your team, a lot of times they’re gonna take that idea like it’s worth a million bucks. And they’re gonna go down the road, and they’re gonna spend all this time. And you’re like, “Man, I didn’t know you were gonna do that.” And all they’re trying to do is impress you. But that idea of C.O.T. is that I wanna give you permission to take an idea and actually be critical about it. And if it works, go with it. And if it doesn’t, throw it away. Giving that permission upfront—I love that because it also saves time, but it allows people to be innovative. It allows people to say, “Ooh, okay, let’s go with this.” So that’s actually a great concept. I love that.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Role of Entrepreneurs and CEOs</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You know what, Terry? That’s a very tactical deal. I used to get out of the car and go into the lottery and look up and think, “Oh my God, $350 million business. I’m in charge of this.” It scared the crap outta me. But then when you open the door, you have the confidence when you walk in to say, “Okay, here’s some ideas.” Because with your confidence, even though you may think, “Yeah or no,” with their experience, especially entrepreneurs that begin a company, they need this.</strong></p><p id="""">Entrepreneurs are often bad CEOs when it’s all said and done because we’re here, we love ideas, we love to send them out, we love to get ‘em going, but you really need to make sure you surround yourself with a good accountant, a good lawyer, a good salesperson—people who are experts in their own field.</p><p id="""">And initially, when you start a company, I tell people, do it as a non-paid board member, and then as you move on, you take care of it back. But if you want to get everything that you know you’re not good at, let them do it. Too many people try to do everything themselves, and that’s where they get in trouble.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">No, that’s huge, though, because these things are so important. At the end of the day, we tell everybody that most entrepreneurs start a business, but their greatest obstacle to growing that business is themselves. The skills and traits it takes to grow a business are not the ones that will scale a business. So there are some rare ones that can be entrepreneurs stepping into a CEO role, but generally, they need to allow a CEO or at least a team to come in. So I like what you said as far as starting as a board member, right? So you can already know you’ve got that transition to make, especially if you’re confident. So that’s cool.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Winning Strategies for the Lottery</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’ve got a random question for you though. You’ve talked about all this lottery stuff. You ran the lottery, you built a lot—you basically caused massive success, identified things. How do you win the lottery? Is that a thing? Is that a question I could ask you? Is it completely random chance that people are spending all this money or—come on, like you gotta give me an answer to that question.</strong></p><p id="""">I can now play the lottery. I've been outta the lottery for two years, and I’ve been playing Powerball and Mega Millions when they get up to the billion dollars. And guess what? I’ve won $4 so far. The lottery is a great institution. The reason I like the lottery is it’s run by each individual state, which means that if you think something’s screwy, you can go right to the lottery office. You can go right to your elected representatives and raise hell.</p><p id="""">You can’t do that if you’re playing poker on the internet to Belize or to Malta or some other place. So yeah, it is an amazing and, I think, a very fair and honest game. People like to gamble. Now, if you wanna win, here’s the secret. The worst payout is the lotto games. They’re usually about 50% of the money going back to the players, but they’re used to build big aspirational prizes. So if you like to win the big prize—if you like to get into raffles and that sort of thing—play Powerball. Play Mega Millions. Play a lotto game.</p><p id="""">If you like to pull the slot machine, win, play again, win, play again, you wanna do scratch tickets. And there’s a little secret to scratch tickets too. Scratch tickets—the lower the price, the less the payout. It’s usually in a 60% payout. A $20 scratch ticket or a $50 scratch ticket has better payouts. It’s more like 75%. Now here’s what I do because I like to win once in a while and say, “Yeah, I played the lottery, and I won.”</p><p id="""">If you have $50, divide it by 10. Whatever your dollar bill is, divide it by 10 and buy 10 tickets of that denomination. The same roll and the same deal—10 tickets in a row. You’ll probably get one or two winners. Now, you probably won’t win more than what you put in, but you can say you won.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You can feel like a winner.</strong></p><p id="""">If you wanna win the lottery, just play 10 of the same ones. You probably put in $50. You’re probably gonna win $20 to $30 maybe, or you might hit a big jackpot, but you’re more likely to win those, in my opinion, than you would if you bought one of this and one of that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The scratch—10 at a time. No, I love that. That’s cool. Hey guys, you heard that here. So don’t spend all your money. Spend your time—don’t. We’re not advocating the lottery, but hey listen, we all take the big gamble, right?</strong></p><p id="""">That’s right.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts and Conclusion</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Terry, it’s been a total pleasure. It’s been fun but also very educational. I appreciate you. How can people catch up on you, find you, where can they connect with you?</strong></p><p id="""">The easiest way is terryspeaks.com. That’s my website, terryspeaks.com. If somebody has an event and has an event planner—if somebody’s looking for the books—you can do that. If nothing else, get a good laugh and do that. I’ve got a TV show that right now is also on Very Local, which is the Hearst streaming service, called Soccer Slam. Twenty years ago, we did a show. They did a documentary on it where we took soccer and thought everybody was bored with it, so we made it full-contact, indoor soccer. We had people fighting, we had—we threw in an extra ball here and there, and then we hired professional fighters.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oh wow.</strong></p><p id="""">So they wrote on it—not just recently announced there. And then we’ve got another documentary I think will come out on the lottery fraud. Should be coming out in the next few years.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. I tell you, I think people get a great sense now of why I started with creative, lucky, energetic, and fraud-busting, right?</strong></p><p id="""">So how about the million-dollar idea though? Can we do that, George, before we go?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, that was my very last question. You—we talked before about you had a new million-dollar idea. So guys, you heard it here first—unless I edit this out later because you can’t hear it, because I’m gonna take it for myself. Go ahead. Let’s hear this new idea you have.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Million-Dollar Idea: Advertising on the Moon</strong></h3><p id="""">Here's the million-dollar idea. So we had Mega Millions, we added Powerball. So we crossed, sold those two together in all the states, and they said, what are some good things? Let's come up with ideas. Remember how we're brainstorming? What's the idea for doing Mega Millions, Mega Millions promoting it?</p><p id="""">So I'm driving, I look up, and there's the moon. You know how you get the moon with just a little fingerprint, crescent moon? Yeah. Oh my God. What if we could get a spotlight or a laser and we could put the jackpot amount on the dark side of the moon so people look up? We could own the moon. This is like the billboard no one has bought yet. So I started calling around astrophysicists. I got hung up a few times. Again, you get the no-man guaranteed.</p><p id="""">Then I got somebody who said, ""You're gonna have problems 'cause you gotta get through the atmosphere. It breaks up if you use a laser or a spotlight."" So my answer today is I need someone who knows Elon Musk. 'Cause we could put the laser or the spotlight on the satellite. Then we could get that focused signal up to the moon. We could own the moon as a billboard.</p><p id="""">Honestly, maybe even 10 years ago, I would be like, man, you are up in the night. But I'm telling you right now, anything is possible. People are building their own rockets. That's actually a killer idea because I'll tell you, that's probably the only real estate untapped right now in the market.</p><p id="""">You got it. Something big.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow, Terry, there's no question. You think big. There's no question. You don't think small. So I love it, man. Talk about innovation—the moon for a billboard. That's a great idea. Hey, count me in on that one. Let's come up with some ideas and work on that baby together, okay?

Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast, George Wright III here. And I'm excited to be able to feature today a guest, Regina Martin. We're gonna get into a lot of cool stuff, but she's an educator, speaker, author, coach.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I'm really excited to have you here, Regina. Thanks for joining us.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍<br></strong>Thank you for having me, George. I'm glad to be here.</p><p id="""">‍<br><strong id="""">This is gonna be good. And I wanna—before we get going, I just want to give a little bit of a background because you've got a pretty diverse, proven background in education and some of the things you're working on. You've got a decade in higher education, and you inspire audiences basically to dare to dream.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So as an educator, Regina's been able to take her expertise from the classroom to stages to her book. She's co-author of a collaborative book called <em id="""">The Fire Girl Code of Conduct</em>. But she also has a book that we're gonna talk a little bit about today called <em id="""">You Belong Here: Transitioning to Success, High School to College Edition</em>.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Regina Martin's Background and Journey</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">And so as we get started, Regina, I want you to just lay the foundation. Give us a little bit of the background of what brought you to this area that you've decided to really pivot into and been successful with. Give us your background, your backstory a little bit.<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">So, my backstory is that I decided going into education was the second chapter of my life. I started out as a government employee. I worked there for many years, and then my daughter got involved in a college program and it really piqued my interest because of the fact that it put me in a different space with different audiences. And as a result of that, what ended up happening is I ended up going back to school and got my master's in education and...</p><p id="""">The rest is history. I just stayed in the education space. I substitute taught, I put myself in a position where I was working with students and around students. I really enjoyed that space and I really found that it was something I was passionate about.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Finding Passion and Purpose in Education</strong></h3><p id="""">One thing that I will say about how I got into this space is that I was determined for the next chapter of my professional life to be something I was passionate about. Some of us go to work every day, punch a clock, cash a check. But for me, it was all about identifying what that “it” factor was for me and how I could be impactful and make a difference. And that is how I became an educator.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. I'm curious because I was gonna ask you—sometimes people unintentionally come across what their passion and their focus and purpose seem to be. But it seemed like you were looking for that, and you learned. And I know that's what you help people to do as well, but you really were looking for that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So there was a moment where you chose education—going from working for the government to education as the area to focus on—but then you also... correct me if I’m wrong, but your primary focus is young women in high school to college students all the way up through professional channels.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what kind of made you decide to do that? Is it because it was the way you bridged the education passion you had with helping people leverage and bridge into life and into careers?<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">Yes. And they're all connected. You are absolutely right.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Guiding Students and Professionals</strong></h3><p id="""">When I’m in the high school space, they’re getting ready to begin the next journey of their life—whether it be college, employment, or military. So they have to be able to know if that’s the perfect fit for them. I talk to my students all the time in the classroom, and the first question that I ask them when they come to me for their first day of class is: “Why are you here?”</p><p id="""">And the general response that I get from these students is, “Miss, you’re on my schedule, so that’s why I’m here.” But that’s not the answer that I’m looking for.</p><p id="""">And I bring it back to them and I say, “Listen. Did you have a conversation with Mom and Dad, and it was decided—or it was discussed—that this was the next chapter for you? Or was it a case where you were determined to come to school and you didn’t have anybody decide for you? Or are you still trying to figure it out?”</p><p id="""">So once I present it to them that way, it helps them to understand, “Oh, so that’s what she meant.” So, am I here because I want to be here, or am I here because I have to be here? Or did I make a conscious choice to be here?</p><p id="""">And when it comes to connecting the next chapter with the college student—when they graduate from college—they're going into the world thinking that they’ve got a degree in accounting, and they’re gonna work for the accounting firm that is gonna pay them six figures, and everything is gonna be as bright as rain.</p><p id="""">I went to business school long ago and far away, and my goal was to work as an executive secretary and have a corner office. I did have a corner job—but it was working at a corner bank. So, I did not work in the corner office, but I worked as a teller.</p><p id="""">That was my bridge from being in a structured higher education situation to aspiring to be something, but it didn’t work out that way. So, as college students, we may aspire to go in one direction, but then your direction may change and you may have to pivot.</p><p id="""">Working with young professionals and women who are seasoned professionals—you’ve gone, and you’ve got the education, you got the job, you’ve worked up the ladder—and then what happens is, “Okay, I’ve done everything. I’ve checked all the boxes. Everything is great.”</p><p id="""">But then there’s something else that you wanna do, but you are so busy rolling out your 9-to-5 and doing what you have to do there that you’re not really focused on what that next thing is.</p><p id="""">When I told you before about being in education being the second chapter of my life, I’m speaking from experience because our lives are in chapters. It’s either:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">You are still trying to figure it out.<br><br></li><li id="""">I know what I’m doing.<br><br></li><li id="""">Or... this is the next chapter, and I’m going to make it on my own terms, in my own way, in my own time.<br><br></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. I love it. Because what’s interesting about how you explain those three different types of markets—where there's high school kids, there’s children transitioning to college, and then there’s young and older professionals... it seems—and I know you're really good at this because you ask the right questions—most of the people in life just don’t have direction, and they don’t ask themselves these questions, so they don’t have clarity.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I think you’re really super good at helping people to find clarity about why they’re even doing things.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Dreaming and Vision</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">But it leads me to a question I was gonna ask you because you’ve talked many times about the fact that you feel one of the biggest problems people have is that they forget to dream—which in my mind is always clarity on your future, whether you are a high school student, a college student, or a professional.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Are you getting clarity? And so there’s this level of clarity, but then there’s this level of dream-building and vision. Talk to me a little bit about that. 'Cause you say a lot that’s the problem that most people have. What do you mean by that?<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">We have allowed ourselves to be dictated by what society says that we should and can do, instead of ripping the band-aid off and realizing, no, I’m not just an executive secretary, I’m not just an educator—but I have much more in me to offer and give and share and pour into.</p><p id="""">I think for me, it’s important for people to understand that your 9-to-5 is not your final destination, and it’s not the period at the end of your sentence.</p><p id="""">When you continue the journey of determining what your dream life is gonna look like, instead of there being a period there, you could put a comma to indicate continuation.</p><p id="""">Turn the page.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So you’re mentioning a couple things that I think, for some people, are very difficult. One is a little bit of a leap of faith to say, “I do believe that I can be more.” And then another one is, “I don’t know how I’m gonna do that anyway.” So I don’t know where we want to start to unpack that. But you told me a story before we got going, which was a really empowering story.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Because I think you’re right. I think a lot of people are stuck in a 9-to-5. Maybe they’re not even thinking that they’re worth more or that there’s more available. And there are other people that are in it—but man, they just... they’re not happy. They want to move forward. But either way, it takes some pretty empowering steps.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Overcoming Fear and Taking Action</strong></h3><p id="""">Sometimes you can’t do that on your own, but it takes empowering steps to step into the unknown.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what do people do? How do you typically help individuals to start to identify what they do if they’re not happy where they’re at?<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">They have to realize that the people that they’re working for—they’re building their legacy each and every day.</p><p id="""">You have no skin in the game. It used to be that when a person retired from a job, they would get a gold watch and a cake and stuff like that. Now, you don’t even get an attagirl or attaboy. They just have the box waiting on your desk and a “Have a great life,” or whatever.</p><p id="""">And the thing is, you have to take control of your destiny. And if you allow other people to define what that is, then you are going to continue to be on this vicious cycle.</p><p id="""">And like you mentioned, people are just not happy where they’re at. You have the power to change that.</p><p id="""">But see, you said something very crucial—people are scared to step out. We are in a comfort zone. As long as the bills are paid and as long as everything is going according to plan, everything is right as rain.</p><p id="""">But as soon as trouble shakes it up, a lot of people don’t know what to do with that. A good friend of mine gave me some great advice. She said, “Sometimes you just have to do it scared.”</p><p id="""">Yes—and sometimes it means that you just have to throw caution to the wind and just see what happens. I tell people that you have to stay focused and you have to be intentional about what it is that you want to do.</p><p id="""">Because the thing is, when you become an entrepreneur, you have to go through the steps to legitimize your business. Because if you don’t, it’s just going to be a very expensive hobby.</p><p id="""">And the question that you then need to ask yourself is: “When are you ready to turn your W-2 into a W-9?”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">No, you’re right. And that—man, if there’s one lesson I’ve learned—after I’ve got eight kids and five grandkids, now I’m at the point where it’s... you know that you have to make yourself uncomfortable in order to get your life moving forward.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And that your greatest life, your greatness always lies outside your comfort zone. And so I think people do have to be willing to do that. I think it does help individuals...</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The DREAM Method Explained</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">...when there are ways and strategies and plans to do it. One of the things I liked about what you had is you’ve got this DREAM method. And we talked about, one of the reasons we wanted to have you on the show is because one of your big objectives is you help people to build confidence, clarity, and live their best life.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So this DREAM method—and I would love for you to maybe just speak to that for a minute—the DREAM method and what it is and why it helps people to explore and create and implement goals that will help them to create their dream life. What process do you take people through with that DREAM method?<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">For the DREAM method, what has to be at the forefront of everything is that you have to identify what “that” is. You have to understand, “Okay, what is it that you want to do? What is it that you’ve always aspired to do and you’re good at doing?”</p><p id="""">You could be someone who has a gift to encourage people. Okay, so let’s say you want to be a speaker, where you provide encouragement to those who no longer know how to encourage themselves. That’s a gift that you can monetize.</p><p id="""">Incorporating the DREAM method in that means you have to be able to identify what that “it” thing is. And then you take every factor of the DREAM method and you incorporate it into what that roadmap looks like.</p><p id="""">A lot of people get stuck when things get too tough. If things are not happening and materializing the way they want them to, people don’t want to really work hard at what they really want—because everybody is in this microwavable society where they want things to instantaneously happen.</p><p id="""">Unfortunately, incorporating the DREAM method helps people to zone in and identify:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Where do I see myself in the D in DREAM?<br><br></li><li id="""">The R?<br><br></li><li id="""">The E?<br><br></li><li id="""">The A?<br><br></li><li id="""">The M?<br><br></li></ul><p id="""">Taking them through those steps—incorporating it as it relates to them and what they’re trying to pursue and what they’re trying to go through—is going to help them to really embrace and appreciate what the end result is going to be.</p><p id="""">And I tell clients this too: You’re the architect of your dreams.</p><p id="""">I’m not talking about a dream where you go to sleep and then you know, you have this dream and you wake up. There has to be a call to action—and there has to be action behind what it is that you want.</p><p id="""">Because it’s not going to be given to you. You have to put in the work, and you have to surround yourself with people that are going to help you get there.</p><p id="""">I always speak to people about the power of networking and collaboration—being able to connect with people that can help you to get to the next point. And you don’t have to reimagine or try to replicate what somebody else is doing.</p><p id="""">If I have a chance to sit with someone—like I’m sitting with you today—and we’re having this conversation today, you have something that is going to help me to propel where I need to go as far as my product, my dream, my vision.</p><p id="""">I don’t know what you know. But you and I having the conversation is helping me to enhance my thought process and my focus—to build on my platform so that I can take my platform to the next level.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Collaboration Over Perfection</strong></h3><p id="""">We make the mistake of feeling like we have to know everything—and that was something that I personally got stuck in. I felt like, “Okay, I have to know this. I have to know this. I have to know this.”</p><p id="""">No, I don’t.</p><p id="""">It’s all about leveraging and being around people that are already doing the things that you want to do.</p><p id="""">If somebody calls you up and says, “I really want to write my first book. I don’t know how to go about that.”<br> I’ve got a person for you.</p><p id="""">They don’t necessarily have to go through me to write the book, but I can put them on the roadmap to help them get connected to the person who can help them write their first book.</p><p id="""">And I think that entrepreneurs, in general, we sometimes feel like if we don’t know everything, then we’ve got that imposter syndrome going on.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. But you don’t have to know everything. You don’t have to know everything. And relationships are the new currency.<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">And that is something that I was told by a mentor of mine a long time ago, and I have held onto that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s true. Once you connect with people and they have something that can help you propel to the next level—that’s priceless. You can’t put a price tag on that.</strong></p><p id="""">There are so many powerful things you said there, and I think you’re right. People have heard the age-old saying, “A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step,” and sometimes the first step is the toughest.</p><p id="""">But getting clarity on your dream, establishing a plan, collaborating with others—those are all things...</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You know, they’re sometimes tough to do on your own. Obviously, it helps to have a coach or a mentor or someone to help you. But they’re all steps that are not really, in the end, rocket science. They’re not a magic pill. They’re simply steps that you have to take out of your comfort zone.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I really love that you wrap it around this idea of your dream. Because at the end of the day, sometimes people have used that whole phrase “dream” and “dream building” too much. But I don’t think they have.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You could obviously say “clarity on your vision” of what you want in your life and lifestyle and things. But I think if you dare to dream, that’s something that actually gives you a vision that can pull you into your direction. And sometimes, the more you have that vision and that dream in front of you, it allows—'cause most people are held back from the past or overwhelmed with the present.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But when you have a compelling, clear vision of your future, it can pull you in that direction. Do you find that clarity is something that helps people when you are working with them?<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">Absolutely. And the one thing that I know about people—and I know about myself—is that the conversations that are stirring up in your head about your capabilities... that’s all they are: conversations.</p><p id="""">Those conversations only come to fruition if you put action behind them. If you say that you don’t have the ability to do X, you allow that subconscious part of you to say, “I really can’t do this.”</p><p id="""">When I was doing a speaking engagement last year in Detroit, I did a rehearsal, and the person that coached me saw a different version of me once I hit that stage.</p><p id="""">And the reason why is because I had to get out of my head. And I think that is the biggest problem for people. You can’t get clarity if you’ve got all this junk in your head telling you what you can and cannot do.</p><p id="""">And you have to be able to say, “You know what, it’s going to take me a little time to get here. But if I have a clear and precise way of what I want to do...”</p><p id="""">This is something that I tell people all the time too: You have to trust the process.</p><p id="""">You can’t—that’s a cliché term, but it’s really true. Just because Susie here on the corner is killing it in her industry... you’re not Susie. You are you.</p><p id="""">And you have to pace yourself according to what your vision is and what you want to achieve. Because when you do things too quickly, you fizzle out. You burn out. You’re not as relevant as you once were—because you rushed it. You went through things too quickly.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">And that’s why I’ve made it a point to tell people: Take your time about your vision and what it is that you want. Don’t rush it just because somebody else is doing it faster than you.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s none of your business. Don’t worry about what they’re doing over there.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. Patience is a hard thing for entrepreneurs, for sure. But...</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Writing <em id="""">You Belong Here</em></strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">One more thing I wanted to ask you about—because we don’t have a lot of time left—but this was something that I really saw you were doing, and I wanted to make sure we had at least a minute on it.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve got this passion for high school and college students. You’ve got a book—<em id="""">You Belong Here: Transitioning to Success, High School to College Edition</em>. Tell me just real quick about why you chose to write a book about high school to college transition and maybe a couple of points about your book. Because I really wanted to point that out.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think it’s a great thing. We’re building, discovering, and teaching the future leaders of tomorrow, and I wanted to make sure we mention that. What made you choose to write that book? And give me a quick highlight of it.<br></strong>‍</p><p id="""">So the book <em id="""">You Belong Here: Transitioning to College – High School to College Edition</em> was based off the fact that that’s my population—that’s who I work with.</p><p id="""">I work with students who have matriculated into my university. They take college courses while they’re in high school, and then they graduate from high school and they come to us and continue their college journey.</p><p id="""">But what happens is—a lot of students come into the college space and they’re not prepared.</p><p id="""">And because I’m a first-year professor—which means I teach first-year classes—I see it more often than not. I see students coming into the college space, and they’re not ready.</p><p id="""">They think they’re ready. They’ve done all the things they needed to do in high school. They were on the honor roll. They were a part of the Honor Society.</p><p id="""">But college and high school—those are totally two different areas.</p><p id="""">And I think what happens is once that shock wears off, and they realize:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Mom is not going to call and wake you up for your first class.<br><br></li><li id="""">You’re responsible for doing that.<br><br></li><li id="""">No, you’re not going to get extra credit—because extra credit in some cases doesn’t exist in college, depending on the course you’re taking.<br><br></li></ul><p id="""">Last but not least, you have to learn about the importance of accountability and how to move in this new environment.</p><p id="""">And the reason that I wrote this book is because it’s just a self-help strategy situation.</p><p id="""">I write about things like time management. I talk about the terms that they need to become familiar with. I penned a letter “From the Desk of Professor Regina Martin,” and I also penned a letter from the parents.</p><p id="""">Because what students don’t understand is—the transition doesn’t just start with them.</p><p id="""">When they drop you off at school and you’re in your dorm room, and they have to learn how to navigate the roommate experience too, right?</p><p id="""">The story... the story is a tale on that. But long story short—with parents, that’s the longest car ride home ever.</p><p id="""">When you drop your kid off to college for their first year, you’re like, “Oh my goodness...” You’re gonna go in the room, and there’s not going to be a body in there watching Netflix.</p><p id="""">Yeah, there’s going to be a person that’s actually on campus.</p><p id="""">So <em id="""">You Belong Here</em> is a book that’s actually going to be part of a series.</p><p id="""">I’m going to be talking about different facets of the college experience. I’m going to be talking about adult learners—because I do work with online adult learners coming back to school.</p><p id="""">I’m also going to be doing a series on student-athletes. But I’m also going to be talking about students who have learning disabilities—because, yeah, they belong there just like everyone else.</p><p id="""">It’s just that they may have a deficit that somebody else doesn’t have—but that doesn’t mean they don’t belong in the college space.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’ll tell you what I love about you starting with that book is—obviously, in the circles that I’m in and the people that I’m working with, I come across a lot of professional high-end coaches and professional CEO mentors and things like this.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And obviously, most people get to a point in their life where they’re trying to figure out how to define their dream and their journey. And it’s rare that I find—and that’s why I was really drawn to have you on the show—someone who starts where we should have started.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And that’s why—<em id="""">You Belong Here</em>—helping you to define your journey early on makes such an impact on the rest of your life. And so I really would encourage anyone listening to check it out.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion and Contact Information</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Regina, we’re out of time, but I wanted to ask—what’s the best way for people to connect with you?

Welcome back to the Daily Mastermind, George Wright III here with your daily dose of inspiration, motivation, and education. And I'm excited to be able to feature today a guest, Regina Martin. We're gonna get into a lot of cool stuff, but she's an educator, speaker, author, coach.I'm really excited to have you here, Regina. Thanks for joining us.‍Thank you for having me, George. I'm glad to be here.‍This is gonna be good. And I wanna—before we get going, I just want to give a little bit of a background because you've got a pretty diverse, proven background in education and some of the things you're working on. You've got a decade in higher education, and you inspire audiences basically to dare to dream.So as an educator, Regina's been able to take her expertise from the classroom to stages to her book. She's co-author of a collaborative book called The Fire Girl Code of Conduct. But she also has a book that we're gonna talk a little bit about today called You Belong Here: Transitioning to Success, High School to College Edition.Regina Martin's Background and JourneyAnd so as we get started, Regina, I want you to just lay the foundation. Give us a little bit of the background of what brought you to this area that you've decided to really pivot into and been successful with. Give us your background, your backstory a little bit.‍So, my backstory is that I decided going into education was the second chapter of my life. I started out as a government employee. I worked there for many years, and then my daughter got involved in a college program and it really piqued my interest because of the fact that it put me in a different space with different audiences. And as a result of that, what ended up happening is I ended up going back to school and got my master's in education and...The rest is history. I just stayed in the education space. I substitute taught, I put myself in a position where I was working with students and around students. I really enjoyed that space and I really found that it was something I was passionate about.Finding Passion and Purpose in EducationOne thing that I will say about how I got into this space is that I was determined for the next chapter of my professional life to be something I was passionate about. Some of us go to work every day, punch a clock, cash a check. But for me, it was all about identifying what that “it” factor was for me and how I could be impactful and make a difference. And that is how I became an educator.Yeah. I'm curious because I was gonna ask you—sometimes people unintentionally come across what their passion and their focus and purpose seem to be. But it seemed like you were looking for that, and you learned. And I know that's what you help people to do as well, but you really were looking for that.So there was a moment where you chose education—going from working for the government to education as the area to focus on—but then you also... correct me if I’m wrong, but your primary focus is young women in high school to college students all the way up through professional channels.So what kind of made you decide to do that? Is it because it was the way you bridged the education passion you had with helping people leverage and bridge into life and into careers?‍Yes. And they're all connected. You are absolutely right.Guiding Students and ProfessionalsWhen I’m in the high school space, they’re getting ready to begin the next journey of their life—whether it be college, employment, or military. So they have to be able to know if that’s the perfect fit for them. I talk to my students all the time in the classroom, and the first question that I ask them when they come to me for their first day of class is: “Why are you here?”And the general response that I get from these students is, “Miss, you’re on my schedule, so that’s why I’m here.” But that’s not the answer that I’m looking for.And I bring it back to them and I say, “Listen. Did you have a conversation with Mom and Dad, and it was decided—or it was discussed—that this was the next chapter for you? Or was it a case where you were determined to come to school and you didn’t have anybody decide for you? Or are you still trying to figure it out?”So once I present it to them that way, it helps them to understand, “Oh, so that’s what she meant.” So, am I here because I want to be here, or am I here because I have to be here? Or did I make a conscious choice to be here?And when it comes to connecting the next chapter with the college student—when they graduate from college—they're going into the world thinking that they’ve got a degree in accounting, and they’re gonna work for the accounting firm that is gonna pay them six figures, and everything is gonna be as bright as rain.I went to business school long ago and far away, and my goal was to work as an executive secretary and have a corner office. I did have a corner job—but it was working at a corner bank. So, I did not work in the corner office, but I worked as a teller.That was my bridge from being in a structured higher education situation to aspiring to be something, but it didn’t work out that way. So, as college students, we may aspire to go in one direction, but then your direction may change and you may have to pivot.Working with young professionals and women who are seasoned professionals—you’ve gone, and you’ve got the education, you got the job, you’ve worked up the ladder—and then what happens is, “Okay, I’ve done everything. I’ve checked all the boxes. Everything is great.”But then there’s something else that you wanna do, but you are so busy rolling out your 9-to-5 and doing what you have to do there that you’re not really focused on what that next thing is.When I told you before about being in education being the second chapter of my life, I’m speaking from experience because our lives are in chapters. It’s either:You are still trying to figure it out.I know what I’m doing.Or... this is the next chapter, and I’m going to make it on my own terms, in my own way, in my own time.I love it. I love it. Because what’s interesting about how you explain those three different types of markets—where there's high school kids, there’s children transitioning to college, and then there’s young and older professionals... it seems—and I know you're really good at this because you ask the right questions—most of the people in life just don’t have direction, and they don’t ask themselves these questions, so they don’t have clarity.And I think you’re really super good at helping people to find clarity about why they’re even doing things.The Importance of Dreaming and VisionBut it leads me to a question I was gonna ask you because you’ve talked many times about the fact that you feel one of the biggest problems people have is that they forget to dream—which in my mind is always clarity on your future, whether you are a high school student, a college student, or a professional.Are you getting clarity? And so there’s this level of clarity, but then there’s this level of dream-building and vision. Talk to me a little bit about that. 'Cause you say a lot that’s the problem that most people have. What do you mean by that?‍We have allowed ourselves to be dictated by what society says that we should and can do, instead of ripping the band-aid off and realizing, no, I’m not just an executive secretary, I’m not just an educator—but I have much more in me to offer and give and share and pour into.I think for me, it’s important for people to understand that your 9-to-5 is not your final destination, and it’s not the period at the end of your sentence.When you continue the journey of determining what your dream life is gonna look like, instead of there being a period there, you could put a comma to indicate continuation.Turn the page.‍So you’re mentioning a couple things that I think, for some people, are very difficult. One is a little bit of a leap of faith to say, “I do believe that I can be more.” And then another one is, “I don’t know how I’m gonna do that anyway.” So I don’t know where we want to start to unpack that. But you told me a story before we got going, which was a really empowering story.Because I think you’re right. I think a lot of people are stuck in a 9-to-5. Maybe they’re not even thinking that they’re worth more or that there’s more available. And there are other people that are in it—but man, they just... they’re not happy. They want to move forward. But either way, it takes some pretty empowering steps.Overcoming Fear and Taking ActionSometimes you can’t do that on your own, but it takes empowering steps to step into the unknown.So what do people do? How do you typically help individuals to start to identify what they do if they’re not happy where they’re at?‍They have to realize that the people that they’re working for—they’re building their legacy each and every day.You have no skin in the game. It used to be that when a person retired from a job, they would get a gold watch and a cake and stuff like that. Now, you don’t even get an attagirl or attaboy. They just have the box waiting on your desk and a “Have a great life,” or whatever.And the thing is, you have to take control of your destiny. And if you allow other people to define what that is, then you are going to continue to be on this vicious cycle.And like you mentioned, people are just not happy where they’re at. You have the power to change that.But see, you said something very crucial—people are scared to step out. We are in a comfort zone. As long as the bills are paid and as long as everything is going according to plan, everything is right as rain.But as soon as trouble shakes it up, a lot of people don’t know what to do with that. A good friend of mine gave me some great advice. She said, “Sometimes you just have to do it scared.”Yes—and sometimes it means that you just have to throw caution to the wind and just see what happens. I tell people that you have to stay focused and you have to be intentional about what it is that you want to do.Because the thing is, when you become an entrepreneur, you have to go through the steps to legitimize your business. Because if you don’t, it’s just going to be a very expensive hobby.And the question that you then need to ask yourself is: “When are you ready to turn your W-2 into a W-9?”No, you’re right. And that—man, if there’s one lesson I’ve learned—after I’ve got eight kids and five grandkids, now I’m at the point where it’s... you know that you have to make yourself uncomfortable in order to get your life moving forward.And that your greatest life, your greatness always lies outside your comfort zone. And so I think people do have to be willing to do that. I think it does help individuals...The DREAM Method Explained...when there are ways and strategies and plans to do it. One of the things I liked about what you had is you’ve got this DREAM method. And we talked about, one of the reasons we wanted to have you on the show is because one of your big objectives is you help people to build confidence, clarity, and live their best life.So this DREAM method—and I would love for you to maybe just speak to that for a minute—the DREAM method and what it is and why it helps people to explore and create and implement goals that will help them to create their dream life. What process do you take people through with that DREAM method?‍For the DREAM method, what has to be at the forefront of everything is that you have to identify what “that” is. You have to understand, “Okay, what is it that you want to do? What is it that you’ve always aspired to do and you’re good at doing?”You could be someone who has a gift to encourage people. Okay, so let’s say you want to be a speaker, where you provide encouragement to those who no longer know how to encourage themselves. That’s a gift that you can monetize.Incorporating the DREAM method in that means you have to be able to identify what that “it” thing is. And then you take every factor of the DREAM method and you incorporate it into what that roadmap looks like.A lot of people get stuck when things get too tough. If things are not happening and materializing the way they want them to, people don’t want to really work hard at what they really want—because everybody is in this microwavable society where they want things to instantaneously happen.Unfortunately, incorporating the DREAM method helps people to zone in and identify:Where do I see myself in the D in DREAM?The R?The E?The A?The M?Taking them through those steps—incorporating it as it relates to them and what they’re trying to pursue and what they’re trying to go through—is going to help them to really embrace and appreciate what the end result is going to be.And I tell clients this too: You’re the architect of your dreams.I’m not talking about a dream where you go to sleep and then you know, you have this dream and you wake up. There has to be a call to action—and there has to be action behind what it is that you want.Because it’s not going to be given to you. You have to put in the work, and you have to surround yourself with people that are going to help you get there.I always speak to people about the power of networking and collaboration—being able to connect with people that can help you to get to the next point. And you don’t have to reimagine or try to replicate what somebody else is doing.If I have a chance to sit with someone—like I’m sitting with you today—and we’re having this conversation today, you have something that is going to help me to propel where I need to go as far as my product, my dream, my vision.I don’t know what you know. But you and I having the conversation is helping me to enhance my thought process and my focus—to build on my platform so that I can take my platform to the next level.Collaboration Over PerfectionWe make the mistake of feeling like we have to know everything—and that was something that I personally got stuck in. I felt like, “Okay, I have to know this. I have to know this. I have to know this.”No, I don’t.It’s all about leveraging and being around people that are already doing the things that you want to do.If somebody calls you up and says, “I really want to write my first book. I don’t know how to go about that.” I’ve got a person for you.They don’t necessarily have to go through me to write the book, but I can put them on the roadmap to help them get connected to the person who can help them write their first book.And I think that entrepreneurs, in general, we sometimes feel like if we don’t know everything, then we’ve got that imposter syndrome going on.Yeah. But you don’t have to know everything. You don’t have to know everything. And relationships are the new currency.‍And that is something that I was told by a mentor of mine a long time ago, and I have held onto that.It’s true. Once you connect with people and they have something that can help you propel to the next level—that’s priceless. You can’t put a price tag on that.There are so many powerful things you said there, and I think you’re right. People have heard the age-old saying, “A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step,” and sometimes the first step is the toughest.But getting clarity on your dream, establishing a plan, collaborating with others—those are all things...You know, they’re sometimes tough to do on your own. Obviously, it helps to have a coach or a mentor or someone to help you. But they’re all steps that are not really, in the end, rocket science. They’re not a magic pill. They’re simply steps that you have to take out of your comfort zone.And I really love that you wrap it around this idea of your dream. Because at the end of the day, sometimes people have used that whole phrase “dream” and “dream building” too much. But I don’t think they have.You could obviously say “clarity on your vision” of what you want in your life and lifestyle and things. But I think if you dare to dream, that’s something that actually gives you a vision that can pull you into your direction. And sometimes, the more you have that vision and that dream in front of you, it allows—'cause most people are held back from the past or overwhelmed with the present.But when you have a compelling, clear vision of your future, it can pull you in that direction. Do you find that clarity is something that helps people when you are working with them?‍Absolutely. And the one thing that I know about people—and I know about myself—is that the conversations that are stirring up in your head about your capabilities... that’s all they are: conversations.Those conversations only come to fruition if you put action behind them. If you say that you don’t have the ability to do X, you allow that subconscious part of you to say, “I really can’t do this.”When I was doing a speaking engagement last year in Detroit, I did a rehearsal, and the person that coached me saw a different version of me once I hit that stage.And the reason why is because I had to get out of my head. And I think that is the biggest problem for people. You can’t get clarity if you’ve got all this junk in your head telling you what you can and cannot do.And you have to be able to say, “You know what, it’s going to take me a little time to get here. But if I have a clear and precise way of what I want to do...”This is something that I tell people all the time too: You have to trust the process.You can’t—that’s a cliché term, but it’s really true. Just because Susie here on the corner is killing it in her industry... you’re not Susie. You are you.And you have to pace yourself according to what your vision is and what you want to achieve. Because when you do things too quickly, you fizzle out. You burn out. You’re not as relevant as you once were—because you rushed it. You went through things too quickly.Yeah.And that’s why I’ve made it a point to tell people: Take your time about your vision and what it is that you want. Don’t rush it just because somebody else is doing it faster than you.Yeah.That’s none of your business. Don’t worry about what they’re doing over there.Yeah. Patience is a hard thing for entrepreneurs, for sure. But...Writing You Belong HereOne more thing I wanted to ask you about—because we don’t have a lot of time left—but this was something that I really saw you were doing, and I wanted to make sure we had at least a minute on it.You’ve got this passion for high school and college students. You’ve got a book—You Belong Here: Transitioning to Success, High School to College Edition. Tell me just real quick about why you chose to write a book about high school to college transition and maybe a couple of points about your book. Because I really wanted to point that out.I think it’s a great thing. We’re building, discovering, and teaching the future leaders of tomorrow, and I wanted to make sure we mention that. What made you choose to write that book? And give me a quick highlight of it.‍So the book You Belong Here: Transitioning to College – High School to College Edition was based off the fact that that’s my population—that’s who I work with.I work with students who have matriculated into my university. They take college courses while they’re in high school, and then they graduate from high school and they come to us and continue their college journey.But what happens is—a lot of students come into the college space and they’re not prepared.And because I’m a first-year professor—which means I teach first-year classes—I see it more often than not. I see students coming into the college space, and they’re not ready.They think they’re ready. They’ve done all the things they needed to do in high school. They were on the honor roll. They were a part of the Honor Society.But college and high school—those are totally two different areas.And I think what happens is once that shock wears off, and they realize:Mom is not going to call and wake you up for your first class.You’re responsible for doing that.No, you’re not going to get extra credit—because extra credit in some cases doesn’t exist in college, depending on the course you’re taking.Last but not least, you have to learn about the importance of accountability and how to move in this new environment.And the reason that I wrote this book is because it’s just a self-help strategy situation.I write about things like time management. I talk about the terms that they need to become familiar with. I penned a letter “From the Desk of Professor Regina Martin,” and I also penned a letter from the parents.Because what students don’t understand is—the transition doesn’t just start with them.When they drop you off at school and you’re in your dorm room, and they have to learn how to navigate the roommate experience too, right?The story... the story is a tale on that. But long story short—with parents, that’s the longest car ride home ever.When you drop your kid off to college for their first year, you’re like, “Oh my goodness...” You’re gonna go in the room, and there’s not going to be a body in there watching Netflix.Yeah, there’s going to be a person that’s actually on campus.So You Belong Here is a book that’s actually going to be part of a series.I’m going to be talking about different facets of the college experience. I’m going to be talking about adult learners—because I do work with online adult learners coming back to school.I’m also going to be doing a series on student-athletes. But I’m also going to be talking about students who have learning disabilities—because, yeah, they belong there just like everyone else.It’s just that they may have a deficit that somebody else doesn’t have—but that doesn’t mean they don’t belong in the college space.I’ll tell you what I love about you starting with that book is—obviously, in the circles that I’m in and the people that I’m working with, I come across a lot of professional high-end coaches and professional CEO mentors and things like this.And obviously, most people get to a point in their life where they’re trying to figure out how to define their dream and their journey. And it’s rare that I find—and that’s why I was really drawn to have you on the show—someone who starts where we should have started.And that’s why—You Belong Here—helping you to define your journey early on makes such an impact on the rest of your life. And so I really would encourage anyone listening to check it out.Conclusion and Contact InformationRegina, we’re out of time, but I wanted to ask—what’s the best way for people to connect with you? I want them to connect with you and check out what you’re doing. I would assume your website, but where’s the best place for them to reach out?‍I would definitely say they can connect with me on my website: IAmReginaMartin.com.That info—there’s information on there about a lot of the things that we discussed today.You can also reach out to me on my Facebook page: @ReginaDMartin.106.And it has information about the journey that I’ve been on as an entrepreneur, different highlights of different features and things that I’ve been doing.Also, people can reach out to me. Like I said, I would say my email—but I’m not going to say that because...‍‍Yeah, I was gonna say—you’ll definitely get blown up.So if you’re listening to this, check the show notes. I’ll put her website and her links to her social media handles and some other ways—because I would highly recommend you check this out.I think there’s a powerful message, a lot of passion around not only daring to dream—but just the fact of realizing... and it’s like I say on this podcast all the time... listen: It’s never too late to start living the life you are meant to live. But you’ve gotta take action.And Regina, I appreciate you being here on the show today. It’s been a pleasure to have you here.‍Thank you so much for having me, and I enjoyed sharing my story. I hope that I inspired others as well.I’m sure you have. I’m sure you have.Listen everybody—we appreciate you listening and tuning in today. Make sure you share this show. And if you have any feedback, go ahead and hit us up on The Daily Mastermind over at Valiant CEO Magazine. And we’ll look forward to talking with you again more tomorrow.

Let me give you a quick introduction to our guest.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Doug Noll’s story is extraordinary. Born partially deaf, nearly blind, and crippled, he overcame those challenges to graduate from Dartmouth College and pursue a 22-year career as a lawyer. He likes to say he’s a ""lawyer turned peacemaker."" Doug has transitioned from practicing law to groundbreaking work in de-escalation and conflict resolution, impacting thousands of lives.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Doug is a mediator, trainer, coach, and bestselling author of four books. His work has earned numerous accolades, including <em id="""">Lawyer of the Year</em>. Today, we’ll discuss peace, conflict, and the power of emotional intelligence. Doug Noll, welcome to the show. How are you doing today?</strong></p><p id="""">I’m doing great, George. Thanks for having me on the show.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’ve been learning more about your journey, and I have to say, transitioning from lawyer to peacemaker is quite the pivot. Let’s dive into your backstory. What inspired you to make that shift?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Doug's Journey from Lawyer to Peacemaker</strong></h3><p id="""">It didn’t happen overnight, that’s for sure. I attended Dartmouth College, majored in English literature, and eventually went to law school. After working for an appellate judge for a year, I joined a private practice in central California in 1978. My first jury trial was two months later, and my second was a seven-month securities fraud case worth $36 million in federal court. That’s how my career started.</p><p id="""">For 22 years, I was deeply entrenched in trial law. But in my 30s, I took up martial arts, eventually earning a second-degree black belt. When I turned 40, my teacher told me to study Tai Chi. That’s where things began to change.</p><p id="""">Tai Chi teaches two paradoxes: The softer you are, the stronger you are and the more vulnerable you are, the more powerful you are.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s profound. Those principles can apply to life and business, too.</strong></p><p id="""">At first, I didn’t get it. As a trial lawyer, I saw litigation as war. But as I practiced Tai Chi, it started to seep into my soul. One day in court, while cross-examining a witness, I thought, <em id="""">What am I doing here?</em> That moment changed everything.</p><p id="""">After that trial, I went on a whitewater rafting trip in Idaho. For 10 days, I reflected on my career and realized I had truly served only about five people in over 20 years. That was unacceptable to me. When I returned, I heard a radio announcement for a master’s degree in peacemaking and conflict studies at Fresno Pacific University. It felt like fate.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Pursuing a New Path in Peacemaking</strong></h3><p id="""">I enrolled in the program while still working full-time as a trial lawyer and teaching law part-time. My law partners didn’t support my decision—they saw me as one of the firm’s top earners—but I knew I had to follow this path. In 2000, I gave them a week’s notice, walked away from a $10 million partnership, and started my practice as a mediator, arbitrator, and peacemaker. Best decision I ever made.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">One of the phrases you use that caught my attention is <em id="""">“listening others into existence.”</em> You also emphasize listening to emotions, not words. Can you explain the difference between emotional intelligence and emotional competency, and how they tie into this concept?</strong></p><p id="""">Emotional intelligence is a test that measures three skills: emotional self-awareness, emotional self-regulation, and cognitive and affective empathy. However, emotional intelligence itself isn’t something you can learn—it’s an assessment. What you can develop are the skills it measures.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a huge myth you just busted. I always thought emotional intelligence was something you could learn.</strong></p><p id="""">No, but by learning and practicing skills like emotional self-awareness and empathy, you can improve your emotional intelligence score. One powerful tool for this is called affect labeling, which I’ve refined over years of practice.</p><p id="""">Affect labeling is the practice of naming someone’s emotions. Neuroscience shows that when you reflect someone’s emotions back to them, it calms their brain in about 90 seconds. The emotional centers of their brain deactivate while the prefrontal cortex takes over, helping them regain control.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Practical Application of Affect Labeling</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Can you give an example of affect labeling in action?</strong></p><p id="""">Let’s say you’re furious. I might say, <em id="""">“George, you’re really angry and frustrated. You feel disrespected and unappreciated. You’re anxious, worried, and even hopeless.”</em> As I name these emotions, your brain begins to calm down. It works universally—across cultures, languages, and situations.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How does this apply to leadership?</strong></p><p id="""">Great leaders create emotional safety. Google’s research shows that top-performing teams thrive because of psychological safety. When people feel safe, they’re more creative, collaborative, and productive. As a leader, if you focus on emotions—recognizing and validating them—you’ll build loyalty, trust, and connection.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts and Resources</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Doug, this has been an eye-opening conversation.

You have an amazing background. I was amazed by how knowledgeable you are about everything. Maybe you could start by giving everybody a little bit of a background. What inspired you to get into and start your business, which is </strong><a href=""https://www.preventandrestorept.com/"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">Prevent &amp; Restore Physical Therapy</strong></a><strong id="""">? How did you get into that whole arena? </strong></p><p id="""">Thanks for such a glowing welcome. We’ll get right into it. I’ve been very fortunate to know what I want to do for a living. That being said, from a young age of adolescence, I’ve always been into health and wellness, performance training, and strength and conditioning. I’ve always been into science and healthcare. I let that guide me a little bit.</p><p id="""">To give you the honest answer, physical therapy is powerful. It’s rewarding to be able to help someone and be able to be that beacon of a different alternative modality to get someone out of pain. To be vulnerable for a second with you, if I may, it hits close to home. My mother had several injuries. I was at that awkward age where she didn’t leave me to stay at home alone because we’d burn the house down.</p><p id="""">She would take me to her PT appointments. I was like, “This is cool. This guy’s running out of a gym. He has bands and a trampoline. Does he play for a living? This is nuts.” I don’t think I realized how much schooling went into that. Long story short, my mother had some substance abuse issues that PT helped her with. To me, that was so powerful to see.</p><p id="""">That was almost a hand reaching out to my mother to help her wean off some of those bad habits that take control of her life and not need that alternative modality of the over-prescription of opioids, narcotics, muscle relaxers, drugs, this, and that. You go to the doctor, and you get passed around. That, in a nutshell, narrowed it down to I may want to become a physical therapist. I never wanted to be able to prescribe medication. I love prescribing movement patterns, strength and conditioning, and stability work. That’s how I became a PT. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Those are vulnerable moments. You’ve got an injury, you’re post-surgery, or maybe you’re dealing with pain, and that pain affects everything in your life. This is why I wanted to have this conversation with you. You have a passion for it. A lot of people go into it because of the prestige, the money, or whatever else.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve got a passion for it, and it came from a real-life story of struggling through some things with your mom. I could imagine any kid going into a physical therapy gym with the bands and everything and having some fun, but you saw some dramatic results. You didn’t just have a passion for it. You went deep down the rabbit hole. You have some amazing certifications. Help me to understand, so that our audience knows your background, these certifications that you have. It is so I understand what it is that you’ve gone down, learned, trained, and studied around.</strong></p><p id="""">Education-wise, undergrad, PT school, etc. Some of the certifications are a little extra stuff. The CSES is the strength and conditioning specialist. What that allows me to do is I’m not just a regular physical therapist. I’m a strength and conditioning coach as well. As a coach, per se, I do a lot of personal training and train my clients. I have the knowledge and bandwidth to not only treat from a rehab perspective with traditional rehab, as doing your 3 sets of 10 to 12 to 15 neuromuscular control and endurance, but we work on stability with the goal of being out of pain.</p><p id="""">What performance training is, and the certification allows me to push the envelope forward, is that once it gets you out of pain at a higher level, we work on explosiveness. We work on strength development and power. That’s stuff that insurance doesn’t pay for. That’s stuff that is upper echelon in the sense that, in a traditional model, that’s not one-on-one as I practice here at Prevent &amp; Restore.</p><p id="""">I’ve had this happen before, which is sad. A patient goes from, “I’m in a lot of pain,” to, “I’m feeling a little better, but I’m not there yet.” Guess what? You’re not in enough pain to warrant more PT, so you’re dying. You’re cooked. You’re like, “I can’t return to tennis or baseball.” You’re out of enough pain for insurance to pay for. That’s why I got out of that big market, along with a lot of other reasons I can go into if we need to.</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/68d5689ecde614b15d270d6c_68c058cfe9e5f92c30a58dc2_Graphics%2520-%2520Guest%2520Square%2520-%2520AIP%2520S2%2520E1%2520Dr.%2520Ray%2520Waters.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Ray Waters | Physical Therapy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s huge on the certifications.

Having the certification, but then the application of it, like strength, conditioning, and things like that. It’s not just like a rehab. That’s good.</strong></p><h3 id="""">Why Business Owners Should Wear Three Hats</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">We have a lot of entrepreneurs and business owners here. When you started your business, was it a little more than you thought it was going to be? You had this passion that you wanted to run into, and you got to build a business. Was this more than you thought you signed up for? What are some of the challenges that you’ve had to overcome as you started to build your business?</strong></p><p id="""">That’s a question that keeps us all up at night at times. There have been nights when I’m working and I’m like, “What am I doing? I went from being a PT to doing this.” The biggest surprise for me was the amount of time and energy. It was the amount of energy you spend on doing things that don’t drive revenue immediately, per se.</p><p id="""">Have you read the book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><em id="""">E-Myth Revisited</em></a>? It’s a very popular book.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">It’s an awesome book. I love that to the core. If any of the readers here have not read it, please read that book. It offers a lot of great perspectives. You, as a business owner, and a lot of the other readers could appreciate this. You have to have the perspective to be three different people, in a sense. </p><p id="""">You’re the technician. I’m a PT. I’m a clinician. I already know how to do that. To me, that’s the easy part, in a sense. Do you have the capacity to set aside time each week to be the manager, to look in the past, and to look at what has worked and what has not worked, more importantly? Were your forecasts and predictions correct? Were these trends working?</p><p id="""">There’s the entrepreneur. There’s the future of looking in front of you at things you want to try and markets you want to tap into. There are doctors, in my case, and surgeons I want to connect with and talk to. There are baseball coaches I want to talk to. There are gyms I want to get in contact with. That’s the creative entrepreneur. They’re forward-thinking. You've got to be organized with the numbers and nitty-gritty business behind you. You've got to be the technician and do the job. If you’re not good at being a PT, no matter how good you are at crunching numbers, you have to deliver.</p><h3 id="""">How One-On-One Approach Works In Physical Therapy</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s the reason why a lot of businesses fail. They get into it for their passion. They don’t realize the heavy lifting, or they’re distracted by the heavy lifting, so they’re not successful. You want to be working with a business and a therapist who’s successful. One of the reasons why I wanted to interview you and get some content from you is that you’ve adopted this one-on-one approach.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m curious. Before we go into some specialization, which a lot of our readers can benefit from, I want to ask you why you chose to go down that route. Even if you have a passion for it and you start a business, a lot of people get into it and think, “What’s the quickest road to make some money and pay off my loan, my debts, and things like this?” You chose a one-on-one approach versus a business. When I say that, I’m saying your time would be better spent at high volume. Give me some of your thoughts on that and why you chose that, given your profession.</strong></p><p id="""">I could talk until Saturday afternoon about this answer. There’s so much to discuss, but I’ll keep it short. The main reason is patient care. Patient care is meant to be best served in a one-on-one capacity. To tell you a quick story, if I may, I’ll tell you about one of the worst days of my corporate career before I made the leap. It was a day when I was seeing three patients in an hour.</p><blockquote id="""">Patient care is best served in a one-on-one capacity.</blockquote><p id="""">One had a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, which is when they put a new shoulder in. One had an anterior cervical disc fusion, where they fuse your vertebrae together from top to bottom. Another patient was a workers’ comp patient. The poor fellow broke his ankle. They didn’t send a translator. I don’t speak Spanish. Each one of these patients deserves one-on-one care. You send me two post-op patients, and I could spend a whole hour on each of those, working on their neck or working on this gentleman’s shoulder to get his range of motion back. I’m like, “Dolor aquí?” I don’t even know how to talk. I can’t communicate. That was so frustrating. I will never forget it.</p><p id="""">If you remember that book, one of my favorite parts that spoke out to me is the entrepreneurial seizure where you short-circuit. That was my seizure, in a sense. I could never go back to how I was prior to that. I went to management, and I was like, “I’m not proud of what I did.” I wasn’t set up for success. I couldn’t deliver to my patients. I know I can deliver, but I wasn’t set up for it. I physically couldn’t.” That ate me up.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What made you decide to make the move? I’m curious about that, and then I want to make a couple of comments about what you said. What made you decide to make the move? Was it that experience, or had you been pre-thinking about that for a while?</strong></p><p id="""">I had been thinking about it for a while. I never saw myself in PT school as owning my own practice. I never saw myself as a businessman. I just wanted to treat patients. I enjoy this so much. I cannot express to you how awesome and rewarding a job it is. What made me change, to be honest, was never doing good enough, and the company always wanted more out of you. I’ll tell you another quick little story. At this said corporate job, on my 3-year anniversary, my manager at the time threw 3 bags of gas station almonds at me. One for each year, I guess. If I stick around for five years, maybe they’d get me shoes. I’m like, “I got it.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Here’s your passion. You’re not getting rewarded. You’re not doing the job you feel like you should be doing and that the clients need.</strong></p><p id="""">It was like, “We’re not even going to talk about a raise here. You’re throwing food at me. I come to work every day. I’ve never missed a day of work in three years, and you’re going to throw food at me.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’re describing a lot of people, even when they own their business sometimes, who are on this treadmill, and they’re not willing to do it. I feel like it’s so appropriate to point this out to our audience. A lot of people recognize that they’re not being fulfilled. They recognize they’re not doing their best job. They’re not unleashing their real potential, but they don’t make the decision to do it. That’s way outside your comfort zone, and the best life you have is always outside your comfort zone. Your best ability to be the best you could be for clients is not going to be something you thought about and were comfortable with, but you did it anyway.</strong></p><p id="""">At the end of the day, the biggest mover was when I’m sitting in the car, dreading going to work. The real shame of this is that when I was fifteen years old with my mom, I decided I wanted to become a PT, and then I became a PT. I did all this training. There’s a carrot in front of my face, and I’m chasing it. I get to the top of the mountain, or the proverbial top. I made it, I got my degree, and I’m ready to roll, but I’m like, “It sucks.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s not what you envisioned.</strong></p><p id="""">Our readers here can probably appreciate and relate to this. I truly felt that the fear of resenting what you do for a living was around the corner. I knew that if I didn’t make a change, I would end up not liking or, God forbid, despising something I thought I wanted to do with my life. I was afforded an opportunity for some mentorship and work in private practice. I got away from that corporate world. I started learning the ways and how to do this private practice world, and I was like, “I can do this. I am worth this. I can make people better more quickly and get results, and I can make money doing it.”</p><blockquote id="""">If you feel resentment towards what you do for a living, do not waste your time and make a change.</blockquote><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. This is a great lesson. Success leaves clues. You didn’t have to know what you were going to do, but you knew you had to do something. You described what a lot of people, even those who own their own businesses, are dealing with, and that is that they know that they’re not doing what they need to do. They’re not going in the direction they need to go. It’s going to start to stack up, and they’re going to start to build in. That’s why it’s the cause of a lot of depression, anxiety, stress, and other things.</strong></p><h3 id="""">Treating Professional Athletes And High-Performance Individuals</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to pivot because I know we don’t have a ton of time, and I have a bunch of stuff I want to ask you. I want to pivot into something else along the lines of what I asked a minute ago. Alex Hormozi talks a lot about scaling the unscalable. Most businesses start, and they think, “I've got to do it this way. There’s no way I could continue to work one-on-one.” The ultimate goal of supplying the best service for a client required that, so you decided to stay hyper-focused on doing these personalized one-on-one deals, even though it may not be scalable.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What happens is in time, people start to recognize your authority and your expertise. You get paid more, and then you can go to that point. You did stay focused on that, and you went one level deeper into some specialization with athletes. I mentioned it in the intro. You talked about overhead athletes. Could you drill down a little bit into that, why you chose that, and what it is that you feel so passionate about when it comes to athletes and high performance?</strong></p><p id="""">Why I feel passionate about that stems from my teenage years. I couldn’t put a ball down. I was always dribbling a basketball, playing baseball, swinging a tennis racket, or going golfing. I love sports. I’m a huge sports buff. That being said, when I got into treating patients, I found that I enjoyed treating that athletic population because they’re motivated. They take what you say seriously. They have skin in the game. They’re hyper-focused on getting back to where they want to be. That resonates through them. That resonates through me.</p><p id="""">It’s so much fun to treat baseball, in particular. That was my first passion. My first love was the Atlanta Braves. Being in East Cobb, Marietta, a lot of people may or may not realize this, but it’s the biggest hotbed in the country for Little League Baseball. I see an opportunity in that market. I love rehabbing shoulders. That’s one of my favorite things to rehab. Treating rotational athletes and overweight athletes is very different than treating a regular person for neck or low back pain.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I was surprised to hear that there’s such a prevalence of shoulder injury in athletes, especially baseball players. Why do you think that is? With your background, help me understand why there is so much of an issue with that.</strong></p><p id="""">If I didn’t go with one answer, it would be that the shoulder is not designed to load and throw overhead. It’s designed to be down here and below. We have the most degrees of freedom to move, but we’re talking about loading and throwing something overhead. I was talking to a doctor at WellStar. One of my good friends, Dr. Will Byrd, is the physical therapist for the Colorado Rockies. He’s an awesome guy. I had the same conversation with him as I had with Dr. Steenlage at WellStar. We were talking shop about shoulders.</p><p id="""">The big thing is the overhead component. Softball pitchers don’t get hurt nearly that much. These softball players I see, or your third base, or your catchers who are throwing overhead, throwing and loading your arm down here is much safer, or only throwing overhead with the capacity. These kids don’t get any rest and are asked to train and play ball year-round.</p><p id="""">God forbid, you’re undersized, and then you don’t have a joint capsule developed. You’re throwing as hard as you can and getting by on your weak rotator cuff. You’re fourteen, and you don’t have the endurance to load your shoulder and sustain that. You have a 60 or 70 pitch count. God forbid, the best pitcher on the team, when he is not pitching, is a catcher because he has a cannon. They’re overworked. A lot of times, they don’t have the mechanics, the control of their shoulder blades, and the endurance.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You have a specialty in this. It’s like anything else. If you’re out there in the marketplace, there are generalists, and then there are specialists. You’ve talked a lot about the idea that there are preventative, therapeutic, and then peak performance and strength and conditioning aspects to all that. Do you deal with all of that? Is that something that you take a comprehensive approach to things? What is the majority of your time spent on? </strong></p><p id="""">I take a comprehensive approach. That’s why I coined the name Prevent &amp; Restore, meaning pre-injury, prevent, restore, and post-injury, if you will.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’re helping athletes prevent injury.</strong></p><p id="""">100%. I write a ton of strength and conditioning programs. I help write the programs for a high school rowing club near me here in Atlanta. I write programs for all my baseball players and pitchers. I’ve written my own performance program for a return-to-throwing program when I have to shut a kid down for not throwing for a UCL or a shoulder injury.</p><p id="""">Where do I spend most of my time? In a perfect world, I balance that out, but I probably spend most of my time in the rehab and the restorative part of it. I do offer a lot of functional movement screenings. I do workshops at local gyms, yoga studios, clubs, etc. I try to get out in the corporate world and do workshops about preventative techniques for my desk workers and the people who sit at a computer all day. There has been a significant rise in neck pain since COVID, not because of COVID, but because we’re sitting on our chairs all the time.</p><h3 id="""">Treating Less Active Desk Workers</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to get into that, but before I ask you that question, our whole economy and our whole globe are always about treatments rather than preventative, which is almost an investment in your time, your talent, and your assets. It’s far less expensive to prevent than to treat. It creates more longevity in that. I love that you say you do that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You hit that topic of being at the desk. We can circle back to athletes as well because I know that’s an amazing specialty you have. A lot of our readers are professionals. Most professionals, like athletes, who don’t think ahead of time, don’t think about all the stress they’re causing in their body and their backs. They’re sitting all the time. I’ll go twelve-hour days sometimes. What do you have to say in that whole arena of desk workers? I know you’re pretty passionate about that as well.</strong></p><p id="""">I am super passionate about that. I want to backtrack and extrapolate one thing about what you said about preventative techniques. It’s super underserved. Honestly, a lot of times, insurance doesn’t pay for preventative care. It’s that simple. We don’t make money unless we’re treating you. When we’re treating you for an injury and providing patient care, it can be a patient lost. That’s why I work in this private practice. It’s not insurance-based. It’s all one-on-one and private. I can see the whole person before injury and post-injury. That’s super important.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You hit a point that I want to make sure people don’t go past. That is that a lot of times, our focus goes where things are covered, but we don’t look at the long-term consequences of that. In other words, investing in your health, your wealth, your lifestyle, your focus, preventative, daily rituals, and things like that. You don’t think about it because we’re so focused on the present and the past. We’re not focused on the future. If you think about the future, you would certainly invest in preventive measures for your health.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/68d5689ecde614b15d270d6f_68c0589d3f5050e8f0e309d7_Graphics%2520-%2520Host%2520Square%2520-%2520AIP%2520S2%2520E1%2520Dr.%2520Ray%2520Waters.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Ray Waters | Physical Therapy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">It’s getting up and moving every few minutes. Maybe get on a foam roll or do some soft tissue work. Exercise and move.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Go forward with the desk workers. Tell me about your thoughts there.</strong></p><p id="""">It is interesting how I got wrapped up in having a passionate interest in that. During COVID, specifically, and much after COVID, when we went and got locked down, and most people didn’t have great ergonomic setups at work, they were forced to work from home. I’ve heard horror stories of people working on a bar stool at the kitchen counter, or they’re sitting on their sofa like a shrimp, leaning over their laptop all day. Do that for eight hours a day and see how your neck and back feel.</p><p id="""">I can’t make this up. The amount of neck pain I saw pre-COVID to after COVID is significant. It’s not because of a virus. It’s because of the mechanics of sitting down. If you were to look at a skeleton, you cannot tell me that that thing’s not designed to move. We sit on our bums for eight, ten, or twelve hours a day on a computer. We wait until something’s bothering us to get seen and go to the doctor. That’s how I got into working with a lot of desk workers. I do corporate workshops and show them preventative strategies that they can do at their desk, like take little micro breaks and work on mobility and whatnot. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s talk about that for a second because a lot of people are like, “I’m on a computer all day. It’s my job. It’s what I got to do.” We’ll talk in a minute about whether they’re starting to sense some pain, but whether they are or aren’t, their body are being affected. What are some strategies and things that professionals can do to make sure they’re maintaining their health when they’re sitting at a computer, they’re on a phone every day, or whatever it is? What are some things they can do? </strong></p><p id="""">I’m going to try to take a broad stroke and not get too granular with it. There are three components of it when we think about it. There’s the thoracic spine, which is the middle of the back. How well that moves is there’s the deep neck flexor of how well the neck can hold your head up. There’s the shoulder blade and shoulder girdle strength. Those big three buckets, if you will.</p><p id="""">If you have mobility, endurance, and strength from those three buckets, your neck and back are healthy. What happens is that gravity pushes us downward when sitting. If you round your back, that changes the gravity of the position of the head. For every inch that the head is positioned forward in front of your shoulders, that’s about 10 to 12 pounds of pressure on your disc and in your neck.</p><blockquote id="""">The head is positioned forward in front of your shoulders. That is about 10 to 20 pounds of pressure on your disk and neck.</blockquote><p id="""">If you’re sitting with a rounded shoulder posture and the head hangs forward, and the jaw comes down, we’re loading the neck muscles, upper trap, splenius, and all these muscles in the back of our neck. These muscles are being stretched and yanked out, not to mention the pressure we’re putting on our discs and our joints.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A simple posture. Think about it. You’re thinking, “I’m stressed. I got a lot of work,” but you’re physically loading your body.</strong></p><p id="""">It’s crazy. People don’t realize that. I do this all the time in clinics. Every single patient I eval for neck pain, I ask what they do for a living. A lot of them work on a computer. Given they don’t have any shoulder issues, I have them hold a five-pound dumbbell right next to their side, and then I have them hold it out here. I say, “Do you feel the difference? It feels heavier, right?”</p><p id="""">It’s still five pounds. That’s just physics. That’s called a moment arm or a lever arm.” The farther away something is in front of you, the heavier it is. That 5 pounds is 24 or 28 pounds out here. That head, if you have a good posture, positioned on top of your shoulders is virtually weightless. Your head out here is 60 pounds. Imagine doing an eight-hour bicep curl or holding a bicep curl.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It could be lightweight.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s not that heavy. You could do 100 reps of that and hold it for 8 hours.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Your suggestions would be to get up, move around, take micro breaks, and things like that. </strong></p><p id="""">My suggestions would be, first and foremost, to start by going to see a professional. Have them put their hands on you and see how things are moving, so they can give you their expert advice. I’m a huge advocate of foam rollers. You can do so much over the foam roller, like working the thoracic extension. Don’t just roll the back, but you’re pivoting it and getting mobility in the thoracic spine, and then you can roll your lats, etc., out. Working on the deep neck flexors of the neck is a little bit more granular than we can probably get into over this episode, but your neck endurance is important, too.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I don’t think much about that. That’s a good point. I’ll consistently go to the gym, and I’ll use a foam roller. The first thing I do is round my back, roll out my lats and back, and then roll my glutes and hip flexors. I sit a lot, and it makes a huge difference. I still have that because I’m sitting a lot. I don’t think about my neck and spine.</strong></p><p id="""">Not until it’s too late. If you think about it, it’s funny because what is your neck? It’s no different. It's muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments, and nerves. If you can train a shoulder, the lower back, or an ankle, why can’t you train your neck? No one trains their neck because no one knows how to do it and take care of themselves with preventative strategies. What do you do? You wait until it’s bothering you, and then you don’t do anything. You wait for six weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks, or two months, and you’re like, “I have a bad headache and maybe some tingling in my arm. I should go to the doctor now.”</p><h3 id="""">Looking After Your Thoracic Spine Mobility</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I don’t know if it’s our culture, but they chalk it up to stress. They don’t realize it because they just think, “I have a lot of stress. That’s why my neck is tight, my back is sore, and I have headaches.” There are a lot of physical reasons that can be happening. Let’s assume somebody’s reading and they have headaches and back pain. They know they’re sitting a lot, and they’re struggling with some pain. Maybe it is somebody struggling with an injury. What’s the first step they should take towards getting back to doing what they love?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s tough to answer that question and not give a negligent answer without evaluating a patient. In the 10,000-foot view, it is going to be work on mobility and work on your thoracic spine range and motion. I can’t tell you how important the thoracic spine is. Not to get too doctor speak with it, but it is in the middle of the back.</p><p id="""">Your neck, the middle of the back, and the lower back. The middle of the back is the only part of the spine that’s connected to the ribs. Think about it. Your neck moves a lot. Your lower back moves a lot. You don’t ever move in the middle of your back. Whether you’re a rotational unilateral athlete or an overhead athlete runner, one of the biggest things that I treat, which I address with every single patient I see, I’m not kidding, is thoracic spine mobility. Can you move through the middle of your back? If you cannot, it’s simple physics.</p><blockquote id="""">Whether you are an athlete or a desk worker, do not forget about your thoracic spine mobility.</blockquote><p id="""">A lot of us are entrepreneurs and business owners. We all understand money. I use this analogy all the time with my patients. Think about forces in the body like money. If you go out and buy lunch with your wife or your friends, or if you go buy groceries, which here in Georgia, we have Kroger or Publix, you spend that $100, and it still exists. It goes from your account to their account. It still exists. Money moves. It goes from over here to over here. It still exists.</p><p id="""">It’s the same thing with the body and the stress we put on it. If one part of your body can’t accept and attenuate the forces you’re putting on it, then that’s going somewhere else. The other part of the body doesn’t have the resume to accept that demand that you’re putting on it. That’s why mobility is the easiest thing we can all work on and train safely. I wouldn’t give advice for people to go start strengthening their neck without having a professional show them how to do that, because it’s a little bit more dangerous. You’re not going to hurt yourself. Go foam roll, please. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">One of the reasons why I mentioned to you that I wanted to have you on the show is that we talk a lot about, and most people are focused on, mindset. There used to be no mindset. Mind, money, and business, we got that. The body is your vehicle for all of that. Your body will affect your mindset. It will affect your performance.</strong></p><p id="""">If you don’t have health, you don’t have wealth.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Correct. The whole purpose, which I think mission accomplished on this, is that awareness is the first thing. If you’re not thinking about the fact of what your posture is and what you’re doing, awareness is the key. Prevention is also the next step that most people don’t take. I love that you commented on that. Then, you have rehab, but I also think that peak strength training and elite-level stuff.</strong></p><h3 id="""">Get In Touch With Dr. Ray</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I know you have so much. We talked before about details, courses, and products that you’re doing for both the professional athlete, the professional CEO, and the high-level executive. What’s the best way for people to be able to get in touch with you and connect with you? What’s the easiest way for them to do that?</strong></p><p id="""">The easiest way to do that is through my website. I have landing pages right there. You can visit my website at <a href=""http://www.preventandrestorept.com"" target=""_blank"" id="""">www.PreventandRestorePT.com</a>. You’ll see a landing page. You click, fill it out, and type your name, email address, and phone number. I will get an update and call you within 24 hours or less, usually. That’s probably the best way. I do run a lot of ads on Google and Facebook. If you see one, smash the like button and share it. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I don’t care where you’re at. Even if you’re not in Georgia, you've got to connect with Dr. Ray Waters. He’s got a specialization in a lot of important athletic areas. There are pieces of information that you can apply to every area of your life and business. I wish we had more time. We might have to have you back on a couple of specialty topics because you and I have talked about some other things as well.</strong></p><h3 id="""">Seek Help Before Everything Is Too Late</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">We touched on the idea of business. I like to combine those things, so we’ll have to talk a little bit about that. Before we take off, are there any thoughts, tips, strategies, or recommendations you have for individuals, whether it’s someone struggling with an injury or people who are dealing with pain? Any final thoughts that you might have?</strong></p><p id="""">Go get help. Your body is trying to tell you something. By the time you feel your hamstring cramping because you’ve been sitting all day, it’s honestly a little too late because that’s the ischemic effect of the tissue, not getting oxygen from us sitting down all day. By the time you feel that, you’re already sitting too long. I evaluated a patient who had this episodic tight calf pain for six weeks, and then she strained her calf. That was her body telling her, “Something’s not right. Something’s not balanced. Something’s not moving. Right? Is it the knee? Is it the ankles? Is it the hip?”</p><p id="""">Go see your local PT and have them check you out, because a professional breaking down how you move is unlike anything else. You don’t know how you move. I don’t know how I move. I still go see a PT quarterly, at least. Sometimes, I go see a chiropractor. I go see people to help me analyze how I’m moving. I’m a movement expert. I help people move better for a living. At the end of the day, you don’t know how you move. You think you know how you move, but you don’t know how you move. Go get seen. Go get some expert opinion and professional guidance on that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that you said that because so many times, as entrepreneurs, business owners, executives, and high-performance individuals, we are willing to invest in our wealth and in our business. Investing in your health is important. We also talk about coaches, mentors, and trainers in our business. That’s because they can see things you can’t see. The same goes for your physique, your fitness, your mindset, and your business. I appreciate it. I’m so glad I had you here.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">If this is your first time tuning in, I want you to do me a favor. Not only subscribe to the show, but share this episode. The awareness of what we are doing as professionals, executives, and high performers is going to help people. I want you to share this episode. Remember, and I say this at the end of all of our episodes, it’s never too late. No matter where you’re at, whether you're in pain or no pain, or whether you’re in your business and you’re growing or you’re not, it’s never too late to start creating the life that you’re meant to live. You’ve got to take action. You've got to do something about it. Thanks for being with us. I was with Dr. Ray Waters.

George Wright III here with your daily dose of inspiration, motivation, and education. I'm super excited today because we have a guest speaker, guest interview. I don't do this very often, but I'm really excited to have Rob here today. Rob Kalwarowsky. Did I pronounce that right?</strong></p><p id="""">It's pretty good. Calver.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">All right. Awesome. Rob, I'm super excited to have you here.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Rob Kalwarowsky's Background and Achievements</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to tell everybody just a little bit of your background, because with my busy schedule, it's rare that I take time, but I really dug into some of the stuff that you've got. Just at a high level—and we'll get into some of the details—you’re a TEDx speaker and co-host of the Leadership Launchpad Project. It's one of Canada’s number three leadership podcasts. You’ve transitioned into this whole leadership coaching and speaking arena after being an engineer, graduating from MIT. Ten years as an engineer, you’ve got some great experience and stuff we’ll talk about there that kind of pushed you into this leadership role.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But you’re also a three-time Academic All-American in NCAA water polo as well as a member of the Canadian National Water Polo Team. So I know you have leadership in you regardless of the current focus and emphasis. I've listened to some of the stuff you've done, and I felt it was important to get you in here to talk to our audience. So, thanks for being here, man. Welcome to the podcast.</strong></p><p id="""">Thanks for having me, George. I’m pumped to talk about anything leadership or mindset with you.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s awesome. I know that some people have picked topics that they're passionate about, but this is one that you grew into and found out of necessity. It seems that you have your own story, and I think it would be helpful for the audience to maybe take five minutes or so and just give us your background. Talk to us about what led you from being an MIT grad engineer into leadership in the first place. Obviously, people either find motivation, or they have some kind of problem they’re trying to overcome. So give us just a little taste of your background and what led you into this whole leadership arena.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Struggles in the Engineering Career</strong></h3><p id="""">And like when I graduated from MIT, for four years they’re telling you, ""You’re the smartest person in the world. You’re gonna be a leader. You’re amazing,"" blah, blah, blah. Then I went into mining—coal mining. I moved out west in Canada, and I started delivering value. I think the first year I worked at this company, I saved them like $30 million. And basically, my boss was like, ""We don’t want you to do anything. We don’t want to change. We’ve always done it this way."" He had a lot of mindset stuff that I see now that I didn’t see at the time.</p><p id="""">But basically, he rejected everything that I did. Constantly, he was passive-aggressive. He micromanaged me a lot. There were a lot of elements there that I found were starting to eat away at my self-concept. From a young age, you do well in the classroom, your teachers tell you you’re wonderful. Then in the pool, it’s the same thing. Your parents are like, ""Hey, you’re doing well."" And now it’s like, ""I’m delivering, but they don’t want it.""</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. Where’s the recognition?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. Ultimately, it led me down this path of, ""What’s my purpose in life? Who am I? Does my life even have any meaning at all?""</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Turning Point and Mindset Shift</strong></h3><p id="""">And not long after that, maybe a year later, I tried to kill myself. It was just a slippery slope.</p><p id="""">And George, this is the part that I want to emphasize for folks—it’s not just that element. A lot of what we learn in movies is, ""Hey, you hit rock bottom, and you’re gonna move to the beach and change your life and do all these things."" I didn’t do any of that. I woke up, I went to work. I didn’t change at all. I didn’t know how to change.</p><p id="""">And so I continued to work at this place, which logically I knew was killing me. But I couldn’t get out. This is where a lot of the work I do now with mindset is so important, and that’s why I want to empower folks to become their own leaders—for themselves—regardless of hierarchical control or not, right? But it’s like I didn’t have the ability to choose because of all the stuff that was going on in my head.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And let’s unpack that for a second, because I think what people can relate to, whether they’re a business owner, they’ve got a job, or they’ve got a career they love—because there are a lot of people that have careers they love, especially in our audience.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But I think what happens is you grow up getting conditioned a certain way, and you feel like you’re now in a situation. It sounds like this is the crux of that turning point, where slowly, without knowing it, your self-worth, your confidence—everything is getting eroded, and you don’t realize it at first.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But then, you don’t understand why. It doesn’t make any sense. And so that’s the cause of all this depression, anxiety. People don’t understand that their internal world is being eroded because of—and you made that subtle point—not because you are a victim of bad circumstances, but because you’re allowing all of that—not consciously—to create your world.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So it seems...was there a point in time where you recognized that? Did you do something? Did you hear something? What made you finally realize that was happening and decide, ""Okay, I gotta do something about it""? Was there a pivotal point there—or not? Or was it when you were feeling suicidal? What was it that made you decide, ""Okay, I gotta change""?</strong></p><p id="""">That was actually in 2019. So that was about eight years later. I never had that realization there. I worked there another year, and then I found another job. I left, and then I worked in another company. And then I ultimately found...I started listening to Gary V, Andy Frisella, and Brendon Burchard, and these guys. I liked Gary V at the time. He was like, ""Start a podcast.""</p><p id="""">So I started a podcast. I started doing things. And then, about a year or two later, I hired my own coach.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Okay. That is...that’s critical, man. I gotta stop you for a second. I hate to ever interrupt, but I think the point that people need to understand—and I wanna really draw this to them—is, for whatever reason you did it, people are surrounded by just their environment. Their environment’s the only thing they’re affected by.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The minute you decide to start surrounding yourself with other people—and right now, today, people can do that online—you’re listening to podcasts, you’re listening to Gary V. Those things start to slowly open your mind up, right? And then, at some point, you decided to do something, and it was to start a podcast. So now the shift is happening. So people gotta realize that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What you’re surrounding yourself with in your environment...it’s like what I love—you put on your site, your website: gain the confidence to address your mindset, choose how you deal with your boss, and take control of your work environment. That’s what you did by basically surrounding yourself with all this positive stuff, right?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Environment and Beliefs</strong></h3><p id="""">Totally. And here’s the thing, right? Ninety-five to ninety-seven percent of the decisions we make every day are governed by our subconscious mind and the beliefs that we have. Those beliefs are typically formed from when we’re born to about seven years old.</p><p id="""">And so, all those things—and yeah, think about it—a child version of you is telling you how to operate a multimillion-dollar business or to live your life. For me, I was 35. I was an engineer. And the beliefs that I had were around: if I get an A in school, my mom will love me, or my dad will accept me. And this is for folks out there. It’s not just you. My clients all have similar ideas.</p><p id="""">It’s basically almost everybody. The beliefs and the mindset might be different, but everyone’s dealing with their mindset and how they were conditioned as a child and what they learned. And now, as adults, we have to start to choose and architect our mindset so we can get those outcomes and live the life we want to live.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s funny you say that because a lot of the common message that I talk about is that your beliefs are gonna determine your actions and the steps you take to change your life, right? And people say, ""Oh, I want to change my life. I want to make changes."" If your actions don’t reflect what you’re saying, then it’s doubtful you really believe it. So that’s why we call them limiting beliefs, right? Because these beliefs you have—you don’t look at them as limited or not—but when you start to realize they are, that you can do more, that’s when you become really empowered. So you decided to start a podcast. I just wanna hit on that for a second.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Did you have experience with that? Did you have somebody that said, ""Let me show you exactly what to do""? You were an engineer, probably a pretty sharp guy, graduating from MIT. How did you...that’s not a simple thing. Most people think...what did you do? How did you just say, ""I’m just gonna figure this out""?</strong></p><p id="""">I just basically bought a mic off of Amazon, and then I just figured it out. Gary V was like, ""Oh, Anchor’s good."" And I was like, ""All right."" So I signed up for Anchor. I had a mic, and then I just started emailing people I knew, and we started recording. I found Zencastr when it was early, and I just started doing it.</p><p id="""">It was an engineering podcast. It wasn’t like leadership or anything like that, but it was so core to what I knew and the folks in the network I had that it got really popular.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We did the same thing. Like, I downloaded the Anchor app. I heard of Gary V. Here’s the thing, guys: if you want the secret to how to do anything, it’s this crazy thing you’ve probably never heard of. It’s called Google, right? So you Google it. That’s how I started my podcast. But download Anchor, listen to people that do podcasts. You said something that was interesting.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to make a note for people because, look, guys, listen to me—success leaves clues. Sometimes, if you don’t listen close enough, you miss the clues. One is he started an engineering podcast. First of all, that’s gotta be the most boring topic I could think of—no offense. But it didn’t matter. You were doing something, right?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">From Podcasting to TED Talks</strong></h3><p id="""">So the point is, you started. And if you hadn’t started that journey, do you think it would’ve led you to doing all this stuff on leadership?</p><p id="""">No.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m assuming you’re not still doing an engineering podcast.</strong></p><p id="""">No.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And it wouldn’t have.</strong></p><p id="""">It wouldn’t have.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But starting is what led you there, right?</strong></p><p id="""">That’s right.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. Doing something.</strong></p><p id="""">Totally. So I started that podcast because I needed to build a brand, as Gary V was saying, so I could get out of corporate and sell. My goal was to do engineering consulting instead of working for bad bosses, which I had my entire career.</p><p id="""">And so I built that show up, and I built my audience. That was why I hired my coach, Susan Hobson.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Okay.</strong></p><p id="""">I hired her because I was like, ""I have this audience. I want to monetize them. I need help because I don’t know how to do that. I need help doing that.""</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it, bro. We are on similar paths. I love it because I’m gonna double down and stick a pin in this thing you said. And that is, what you’re saying is: start with something. Guys, listen. Whether you’re in a current business you’re not happy with, whether you’re active at your job, whether you’re doing well or struggling, start with something. But then you noticed he also said he hired a coach.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">At the end of the day, you start with what you know, and then you go to somebody that can help you to take it past that. So how did you choose a coach? I just did a podcast recently on coaches, mentors, and the need for that in your life. How did you find someone? What was your way of finding them? Did you look for a related engineering podcast coach, or did you just look for a personal development coach? Like, how did you find a coach?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, I went to the source you were just mentioning. I just went to Google and Googled performance coaches, business coaches. I talked to a few of them.</p><p id="""">And it was really when I talked to Susan for the first time that I felt like she saw me in ways the other ones didn’t. I didn’t know what that feeling was because I was so dissociated from all the stuff I was still dealing with. It just felt different. And when I’ve coached folks now, often the first session I have with them, people say to me what I basically said to Susan: ""Nobody’s ever listened to me the way you have.""</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Isn’t that crazy? People just want to be listened to. You just want to be heard. And the challenge a lot of people have is they’re frustrated because they don’t feel heard, but they don’t do anything about it. They just stay frustrated. And, guys, I’m gonna give you like a little jump to the case here.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fast forward: this guy’s now in business with his original coach. So talk about going from starting something, hiring a coach, now being in business, doing a TED Talk. We’ll get there in a second, but that’s an amazing transformation. And yet you didn’t have any special leadership knowledge, training, tons of money set aside, or any of that to do it—you just started doing it. That’s crazy.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How soon after you did your podcast, got your coach, did you do a TED Talk? And I wanted to ask you why you chose to do a TED Talk. What was the point of that? And then let’s walk through the experience of planning and prepping for it, because I don’t know if you’re just a naturally gifted speaker and you love speaking in front of people, but 99% of people don’t. So tell us about the TED Talk and why and how it went.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, so this is the part, George, where I really want to inspire folks.</p><p id="""">I walked into Susan’s office in October of 2019, and I did a TED Talk on a completely different topic than I imagined. When I walked into her office, my thought was, ""I’m not a leader. Leadership is basically crap because every leader I’ve ever had was garbage."" So I had a negative mindset. Of course, when I was playing polo, I had a couple of great coaches, but my association with leadership in business was: they’re all terrible.</p><p id="""">And actually, the data backs that up. Basically, 65% of the workforce experiences what research calls a destructive leader, which means they destroy the goals and aspirations of the business as well as the well-being of the people.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Overcoming Nerves and Embracing Meditation</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Were you just completely nervous, not knowing where it was going? Was it a nerve-wracking deal? In other words, it was obviously way outside your comfort zone, which is where most greatness lies, right?</strong></p><p id="""">So here’s the thing, George. When you work on your mindset, you can transform all those fears.</p><p id="""">But we had a morning rehearsal at the TED Talk, and I did it. It was weird because you’re speaking to an empty room, basically. Then they asked me a few questions as part of the Q&amp;A, and I didn’t feel good about my answers. But what I do is a lot of self-work. We use Internal Family Systems.</p><p id="""">So I went and did a meditation with my parts during the break. And where I landed—actually, I’ve always had the belief that I was going to make it happen anyway. And I landed on doing a guided meditation for folks during the Q&amp;A instead of answering their questions.</p><p id="""">So I’m speaking English, and I have someone translating for me into Cantonese. And for the Q&amp;A, instead of answering questions, we did a guided meditation to help people connect with their true selves so they could make better decisions. And it was just an incredible experience.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">In fact, I just replayed a podcast I did a couple of years ago about how to prepare for a presentation. One of the most important strategies is, number one, be prepared. When preparation meets that event, the fears are less, and the confidence is higher—it’s all about that. But I think the mindset piece is something that I don’t talk a lot about with regards to doing some type of presentation or delivering a powerful message.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And so I really like that. But I do think for most people, I believe that getting outside your comfort zone—whether you fumble it all up or not—you’re going to come out of it on the other side just feeling like a million bucks. It’s going to take you to a new level, a new plateau that you can bust through.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Addressing Mindset Gaps and Setting Boundaries</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I know from listening to you, that’s definitely the case. I want to highlight something else because leadership is a very general statement out there. I love that your topic was how to deal with an asshole boss or how someone can deal with their current situation. But I really want to draw this analogy—you put it on your website, I mentioned it before—gain confidence to address your mindset gaps, set boundaries, and choose how you deal.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Talk about those things because I think it applies to more than just a boss. You might be dealing with a toxic relationship, a bad partnership in a business, or all kinds of things. Typically, we talk about strategies on how to deal with that, but you bring it back inside. And I’m a big advocate of inner game creating your outer world, right? Inner world, outer world. But you talk about gaining confidence by addressing your mindset gaps, setting boundaries, and choosing how you deal with things. So just give us a little bit of a taste of that because I know you’ve got a book and some other things. How do you deal with mindset gaps when it comes to having a bad situation you’re dealing with?</strong></p><p id="""">And so this comes back to the mindset and the limiting beliefs that folks have. I’ll use myself as a playbook for folks because I think it’ll help. I learned that I never accepted myself. I had a belief that I was not accepted. This came from my dad—it doesn’t really matter where it comes from. Typically, your big core beliefs come from your parents, a teacher, or some authority figure when you’re a child. Now, by starting to see that I never accepted myself, I had to go outside myself to get the narrative that I was accepted. This started in school: ""Hey, if I get an A, my teacher will accept me, and my parents will accept me because getting an A is reaffirmed."" Then it went into the pool. If I’m good at water polo, my coaches will say, ""Hey, you’re great,"" and my teammates will accept me for who I am. And this continued until I was 25. Then I was doing the same strategy: ""I’m going to perform,"" but then my boss didn’t accept me.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, mental note for the audience: most people look for validation externally to increase their self-worth and self-confidence. What they don’t identify is the core fire—they deal with the smoke, not the flame, the fire, of why they’re even doing that in the first place. Doing that will never solve the issue. You came to the awareness because you did that most of your life and excelled, and then all of a sudden you weren’t getting that. But you’re really identifying— I want people to understand this—that you do have to do the inner work. Like, you have to do it.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">People hear that a lot. I know it’s a little bit of a ‘fufu’ type deal, but inner work means there’s a core reason that you have problems in your life. It’s a real responsibility thing because what you’re saying is that your external world was affecting you, but you recognized it was your internal world that was causing it. Not just causing it, but not validating it. So you did this work, and you found there was some healing you had to do. There were some things you had to identify. Then how did that lead you into, I guess—you call it setting boundaries and stuff? Once you recognized that, isn’t it a work in progress? That wasn’t something that you just figured out one day, right?</strong></p><p id="""">Totally. The deep inner work—I still do it. But it took me—I’ll make this point—it probably took me around 200 deep therapy sessions. I did 100 coaching sessions. I did 40 ketamine sessions. Like, I still do a lot of deep inner work.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Leadership Development and Coaching</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now, the big thing is, if we get back to this thing about the 95 to 97%. I want to pull in, George, what you mentioned about going outside your comfort zone and doing a talk. Let’s take that as an example. You’re out there, you’re listening, and George says, “Hey, go do a talk.” You feel something—“Eh, I don’t want to, that stresses me out,” or, “I don’t want to do that.” And maybe you’re the type who says, “I’m just going to push through that discomfort,” right?</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A lot of high achievers say that. They say, “I’m going to push through anyway.”</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. A lot of us do that, right? And we get good at doing that because we’ve learned that on the other side, we get recognition, right?</p><p id="""">But here’s the difference. When you’re doing a talk, if you come across with this energy—if I had done it prior to me trying to heal—I would’ve come across as “accept me.” It would’ve been about me. Doing it now, I’m accepted because I accept myself. So the talk is about the audience and impacting them to go out and make changes in their lives—to either leave the bosses that are abusing them or manage the bosses that can be managed better. It’s the same thing, right?</p><p id="""">So it is, once we heal what’s going on between our two ears—if we heal that “I’m not good enough,” or “I’m unlovable,” or “I’m not accepted,” or “I’m powerless,” or “I don’t belong,” or those types of things—it changes the 95 to 97% of the decisions that you don’t even realize you’re making.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. That subconscious autopilot of life, which most people are just drifting through, right? I love that. I’ve got to tell you, I really like the fact that what you’re saying—and I realize this: listen, everybody listening to this, they’re on a continuum. Some people push through, some people don’t do anything, but the common denominator here is awareness.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And if you can become aware that your inner world and your self-worth and things like that aren’t going to come from external validation, and you can only deal with it internally—then, once you’re aware of that, you’re on the journey. I think you’re right because I know a lot of big bestselling authors, celebrities, and experts that deal with it their whole lives. That’s the point, right? It is your whole life. But that doesn’t mean you can’t create your best life now and live your best life now.</strong></p><p id="""">For the folks who aren’t doing anything—the reason they’re not doing anything is that you have a belief.</p><p id="""">Your mind has already decided that you’re going to fail, and it’s trying to protect you from taking a risk and failing.</p><p id="""">Yeah. That’s the reason you don’t do anything.</p><p id="""">And even if you do something, your mind has still decided you’re going to fail. So it’s going to set you up to fail.</p><p id="""">If you do the inner work and you can change your mind—which you can absolutely do because I’ve done it—you can change your mind. Then you can believe, “I actually can do it.”</p><p id="""">It’s going to change the outcome.</p><p id="""">Your brain’s not going to sabotage you. Should I call this person to make a sale or not? If you believe you’re going to fail, you’re not going to call that person.</p><p id="""">Yeah. These small decisions you make every day will be aligned towards, “This is the outcome I know I’m going to get because it’s who I am,” versus, “not.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, that’s a huge difference. I think you hit it, and I don’t think people really realize the depth of how powerful that is. The bottom line is, regardless of your core beliefs, your beliefs are going to drive your actions, which create a result. And unfortunately, some people try to validate the beliefs they already have unconsciously. So they put in little effort, and then they don’t get a result, and they say, “See?” They validate their bad belief rather than pushing yourself and putting more action in. Because sometimes, faith and belief—a whole other conversation we can have—but sometimes you have to just trust in your ability.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I think having a coach or a mentor is what sometimes allows you to have confidence or faith in yourself to put more effort in so that you can get a better result and your beliefs can then raise. I think that’s an important distinction. You have some great programs and things like that. I know we’re going to be short on time here. Help us understand what you do now with this new knowledge in leadership and training. You do have some programs and things like that, right? Do you typically take individuals, clients, or groups? What do you do with this knowledge that you have to help people?</strong></p><p id="""">Totally.</p><p id="""">So, for folks out there, I offer one-on-one leadership mindset coaching so we can start to change your mind to become who you want to become.</p><p id="""">We also do group leadership development. So if you have a company and you want to train your leaders—which, here’s a good stat for you: the average person becomes a leader at 29 years old. They only get leadership development training at 42.</p><p id="""">Yeah. So there’s a 13-year gap between when you become a leader and when you actually get trained.</p><p id="""">We don’t even let people who cut hair for a living do it without training, and yet we’re saying, “Oh, you’re promoted. You manage these people. Figure it out.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, that’s why. No, that’s huge because I tell people, look—I’ve scaled businesses from small nutrition, fitness, education, and finance-type businesses to a hundred million dollars, done a billion dollars in sales. The quickest way to scale a company is through your leadership. It’s investing in your leadership. Most people bump up against, “Okay, I’m doing everything.” But if you will invest in your leaders—B2B type stuff here—if you invest in your line-level leaders and managers to develop them, number one, you leverage, and your life is much easier. Number two, you grow as well because learning to lead leaders is a growth of its own. Trust me, man. I’ve been there, done that. It is a challenge. But that’s good that you do that.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Programs and Resources for Dealing with Difficult Bosses</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now, you have a book or an eBook that you said you would be able to offer the audience here.

What is that all about, and what’s inside it?</strong></p><p id="""">If you’re interested—if you have a bad boss or an asshole boss, or if you’ve ever had one, which almost guarantees you have—I have a free eBook for folks.</p><p id="""">If you go to howtodealboss.com, you’ll be able to sign up and get the free eBook about how to deal with your asshole boss.</p><p id="""">Also, if you’re on that website as well, we have a “How to Deal with an Asshole Boss” program.

I am really excited today because we're joined by an amazing individual—someone who’s going to share a lot of knowledge with you. We’re going to touch on everything from leadership to business.</strong></p><p id="""">Let me give you a quick introduction of our special guest, Marty Strong. He’s a retired Navy SEAL, combat veteran, and CEO. His business background just goes all over the place, but we’re going to get into that. He’s a speaker, the author of nine novels, and three business leadership books, which we’ll talk about.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">His most recent book, <em id="""">Be Different</em>, is now in pre-sale. We’re going to dive into it, but Marty, thanks for coming on the podcast, man. It’s good to have you.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. Thanks for having me, George.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I know two busy guys like us—it’s tough to coordinate sometimes. I feel like I say that a lot lately. But man, I’ll tell you what, we talked a little bit before, and I’m excited to dig into some of the knowledge you have. I love different perspectives. You’re a Navy officer, a SEAL, a CEO—you’ve worn so many different hats, sometimes at the exact same time.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Marty Strong's Background and Military Career</strong></h3><p id="""">Give us just a little bit of the backdrop on your story. I think most people are going to ask right out of the gate: What made you decide to go from military to business? Were you always a business guy? Give us the backdrop for a second.</p><p id="""">Sure. So I was born in Nebraska, and I was there until I was about 11 years old. My father started working for the Army—not as a soldier but as an employee—and we ended up spending four years in Japan and two years in Hawaii.</p><p id="""">Then I got back to Nebraska and joined the Navy when I was 17. I made my way to the SEAL selection course in Coronado, California. We started with 126 guys, and 13 of us original students graduated. I happened to be one of them.</p><p id="""">Most unlikely person you’d think to be a SEAL—I was like 125 pounds when I started and 128 when I graduated. I spent 10 years as an enlisted SEAL. I got my undergraduate degree in business administration and was then selected for Officer Candidate School. I spent the second 10 years as an officer and earned my MBA.</p><p id="""">I retired after 20 years with 80 percent disability from various injuries, one of them being a parachute accident.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">After retiring, I went to work for United Bank of Switzerland as a portfolio manager. I did that for eight years until 9/11 happened. After that, I decided to sell my practice and work off and on for the government and different contracting companies—mostly in anti-terrorism and counter-terrorism roles.</p><p id="""">Eventually, I got picked up by a government contracting company and became the CEO of that company. In 2016, I bought a healthcare company. That was a pure entrepreneurial move—not even early-stage, essentially a startup. It had one employee when I bought it.</p><p id="""">Now, that company is thriving and much larger. I’m currently the CEO of that company.</p><p id=""""> </p><h3 id="""">‍<strong id="""">Leadership and Cross-Training in Business</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, like me, you’ve had several careers—several different phases and seasons of your life. Do you feel like they led to each other, or were they total pivots for you? Leadership, especially in the SEALs and military, obviously extends into business. But you went from military to banking to business. Did you always have a sense of entrepreneurialism, or did you pivot into business out of necessity?</strong></p><p id="""">Two answers. First, I’ve always been a lifelong learner. I love Louis Pasteur’s quote, “Chance favors the prepared mind.”</p><p id="""">When I was an enlisted SEAL, I wanted to learn how to be the best SEAL I could possibly be. I read everything I could about military history and tactics. I’d talk to anyone who had been in combat situations—I was a sponge.</p><p id="""">As I evolved as a SEAL, I got into mission planning, which is mostly creativity. I write about this in my third book. It’s very innovative. SEALs don’t do set-piece battles like you see in movies. We get the “Mission Impossible” package—little information or wrong information—and we have to guess and plan creatively.</p><p id="""">That process is very similar to startups in business. You’re constantly evaluating your environment, your team, your product, and your services. Then six months later, you might be in a completely different role. It’s constant learning.</p><p id="""">Managing money as a portfolio manager was also a natural transition. I was analyzing stocks, which are representations of companies. I understood the importance of leadership, long-term planning, short-range optimization, and organizational structure.</p><p id="""">I got to read a lot of analytical reports and see how analysts evaluate companies—their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. That matched up with the skills I learned in the SEALs: mission planning, leadership, and adaptability.</p><p id="""">Dealing with 1,600 clients also taught me a lot about human nature and how people react to stress—especially around money. That prepared me for leading business organizations.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it sounds like a natural evolution. Most people, even if they don’t know the specifics, recognize that military operations—especially SEAL teams—require adaptability, strategy, and execution. Did you have specific strategies or frameworks from the SEALs that you applied to business? Or was it more about personal development and leadership?</strong></p><p id="""">Two things: one at an operational level and one at a tactical level.</p><p id="""">At the tactical level, SEAL teams are very small units, so everyone gets cross-trained. You start as an apprentice and eventually master areas like parachuting, engineering, or boats. Over time, you gain expertise in multiple categories.</p><p id="""">By the time you’re a senior SEAL, you’ve mastered several areas and can train the next generation. That cross-training creates redundancy and bench strength, which is critical.</p><p id="""">In business, I was shocked to see people thrown into roles with no training or cross-functional experience. They were expected to execute perfectly despite having no exposure to other areas.</p><p id="""">So, in every organization I’ve led, I’ve implemented cross-training models. It creates empathy, understanding, and resilience.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s fascinating. It sounds like you’re not advocating for generalists over specialists but rather creating specialists with broad perspectives. Cross-training provides context and understanding, even if you’re deeply skilled in one area.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Leaders don’t need to master every skill, but they need enough competency to understand what’s happening and make informed decisions.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id=""""> Scenario-Based Learning and Handling Stress</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Leaders don’t need to master everything but need enough understanding to make strategic decisions. I think it’s critical, especially for business owners and CEOs, to have a broad understanding while focusing on their core strengths. Let’s dive into that tactical and operational crossover you mentioned earlier.</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. The strategic crossover comes down to scenario-based learning and superior scenario-based training. This is the classical way the military prepares for events that may or may not happen.</p><p id="""">In the military, we constantly work through contingency plans. We create entire mission sets for potential scenarios—reviewing them, revising them based on new information, and then putting them back on the shelf.</p><p id="""">Now, when a real crisis hits, we rarely pull the exact plan off the shelf because the situation is always different. But the training and preparation teach everyone to think contingently, to storyboard problems, and to adapt quickly.</p><p id="""">For example, you could sit a group of leaders down in a tabletop exercise and say, “Here’s the scenario: our primary supplier just called and said they’re out of raw materials. We have two hours to figure out how to keep production running. Go.”</p><p id="""">It’s a made-up crisis, but it forces leaders to think on their feet and work collaboratively. When you do this regularly, the team builds the muscle memory to react calmly and effectively when real crises hit.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. Preparation is such a critical principle in business. It’s amazing how much better you can execute when you’ve rehearsed handling tough situations. It makes me think about stress. SEALs are renowned for handling incredible amounts of stress. How do you manage stress at such a high level, and what advice would you give to business owners and high achievers dealing with constant stress?</strong></p><p id="""">Stress is often tied to fear of the unknown. In the military, we practice failure constantly. This builds psychological resilience.</p><p id="""">For example, casualty drills are a regular part of training. If you’re on a ship, flying planes, or driving a tank, there’s a constant process of simulating things going wrong. Someone might say, “The officer just got hit. What are you going to do, Sergeant? The Sergeant’s down—what now, Corporal?”</p><p id="""">This kind of training makes failure part of the reality. So when things fall apart in real life, you don’t freeze or panic. You click into action, working the problem and finding solutions.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I really like how you phrased that—“practice failure.” That’s not something most people intentionally do. Is there a specific reason you used that term instead of something like “practice execution” or “practice success”?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, I used it intentionally. Practicing failure inoculates you against the fear of the unknown. It’s not about yearning for failure—it’s about building resilience so you can handle failure when it happens.</p><p id="""">In the SEALs, everyone is trained in trauma care, even if they’re not a medic. We train for emergency tracheotomies, stopping hemorrhages, and more. In a crisis, everyone knows exactly what to do.</p><p id="""">When someone gets hit, you don’t have to wait for the medic. Everyone around the injured person reacts immediately because they’ve practiced these scenarios so many times.</p><p id=""""> </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Opportunities in Crisis and Chaos</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a powerful concept—building confidence through preparation. It’s clear that practicing failure removes the fear that often paralyzes people in high-stakes situations. Business leaders could benefit greatly from this approach, especially given how unpredictable the world has been over the last few years. Let’s shift gears a bit. What’s the biggest difference you’ve noticed between military leadership and business leadership?</strong></p><p id="""">There are two major differences.</p><p id="""">First, in the military, you’re surrounded by volunteers who are willing to sacrifice for a mission and for each other. There’s a deep, emotional bond and commitment to the team.</p><p id="""">In the commercial world, it’s nearly impossible to instill that same level of dedication. Most people are self-motivated rather than team-motivated. For example, in my first corporate job, I was stunned to see everyone leave at 4:30, even if a project was incomplete. That would never happen in the military.</p><p id="""">Second, businesses often lack cross-functional understanding and collaboration. In the military, cross-training fosters empathy and teamwork. Everyone understands how their actions affect the larger mission.</p><p id="""">In business, people tend to work in silos, focusing only on their specific role. To address this, I’ve always encouraged cross-functional teams to work together on projects. It builds understanding and ensures everyone is aligned toward the same goals.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, that makes so much sense. Cross-functional collaboration not only builds empathy but also creates a more resilient and adaptable organization. I think many business leaders could benefit from adopting that mindset. Speaking of resilience, in your book <em id="""">Be Nimble</em>, you talk about how crisis and chaos can create opportunities to shine. Can you expand on that idea?</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. In the military, if everything goes perfectly during a mission, leadership isn’t really required. It’s a testament to the team’s training and preparation.</p><p id="""">But when things don’t go as planned, that’s when leadership is truly tested. Those moments of crisis are opportunities for leaders to step up, make decisions with limited information, and demonstrate their ability to adapt.</p><p id="""">The same applies in business. If you’ve trained your team well, they’ll be able to handle challenges effectively. But when chaos hits, it’s also an opportunity for individuals to step up, show their capabilities, and grow as leaders.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a great perspective. True leaders grow and evolve in times of chaos and crisis. It’s not just about surviving the moment but about using it as an opportunity to shine and help others do the same. Let’s talk about your latest book, <em id="""">Be Different</em>. What inspired you to write it, and how does it build on your previous books?</strong></p><p id="""">The inspiration for <em id="""">Be Different</em> came from my experience on the board of Best Robotics, an organization that conducts robotics competitions for 6th to 12th graders.</p><p id="""">At these competitions, no one tells the kids how to solve the challenges. Each team creates its own unique solution. Watching these kids collaborate, innovate, and adapt made me realize they hadn’t been conditioned to think inside the box.</p><p id="""">Adults, on the other hand, often lose their creativity because they’ve been conditioned to follow rules and stay within set boundaries. <em id="""">Be Different</em> is about breaking free from that conditioning and reigniting your creativity.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s fascinating. For business owners and CEOs, how can they foster an environment of creativity while maintaining discipline and execution?</strong></p><p id="""">It starts with giving your team permission to fail. Create a culture where experimentation is encouraged, and failure is seen as a learning opportunity.</p><p id="""">At the same time, be willing to challenge your own assumptions and strategies. Just because something worked in the past doesn’t mean it will work in the future. The world is constantly changing, and your business needs to evolve with it.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Fostering Creativity and Innovation</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s incredible advice.

George Wright III here. And we have something very unique for you today. So let me give you a quick intro to this amazing individual.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">He's an inventor, entrepreneur, and public speaker. He's got 15 patents and licensed products—ones that you probably see every day. You didn't even realize it—it’s going to blow your mind. He’s the founder of Inventor Smart. I could go on and on. I'm going to have him give some of his accolades, but he's been featured on <em id="""">As Seen on TV,</em> QVC, <em id="""">New York Times,</em> and <em id="""">Inventor Digest</em> multiple times. He’s also an author, and so I'm happy to have you here today. Brian Fried, welcome to the podcast.</strong></p><p id="""">Thank you so much, George. I'll tell you, man, two ships passing in the night a lot of times, but we are together and we are going to drop some value bombs here.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So let me start out, even though I gave you a little intro, let me have you give us a quick idea. We're going to be talking today about inventions and taking people's ideas and making them tangible.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How do you make money with them? How do you go to the next level with them? But you are by far the authority that I’ve found in this area from the research I've done and the conversations we've had. So share with me and our listeners your journey. What got you into this vein? Why are you so passionate about it? Give us that backstory before we get into some of the details.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Brian's Journey into Invention</strong></h3><p id="""">I think, George, when I first started to realize that I was an inventor, I started to look and see things that people were doing. I was a pretty good people watcher and noticed things that annoyed me. I thought, ""You know what? I think I’m onto something here.""</p><p id="""">I continued to jot down my ideas, had a pretty decent-sized spreadsheet, and started to categorize them. I asked myself, ""Wait a second, is this only for me, or is this for other people? Is there a big enough market for this, or is it something niche that maybe I might make something on? But where's my opportunity? Where’s that <em id="""">aha</em> moment to say, 'You know what? This is something that I'm going to take to the next level.'""</p><p id="""">So I started to work on some ideas and go through the motions. I started to make a lot of mistakes, which I realize now, and I had some successes, which I enjoyed. Then I started to get involved with a lot of groups, communities, and the industry of invention. People started to ask me for help because I had some levels of success, and it turned into this whole thing of getting involved in the inventor world.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, was there a first invention you did that you remember, looking back, and thought, “Ah, that was the thing that just worked”? Because I'm sure, like most inventors, you probably had all kinds of things that didn’t work. But what was that first big win or big idea?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. One of the first ones that I actually brought to life was called the <em id="""">Balloon-a-Band.</em> You’re not going to be able to purchase it today, but I’m just going back—look, I’m 50 now, so I guess I started almost 20-something, almost 30 years ago.</p><p id="""">It was a nylon wristband that had a metal D-ring on the outside of it and some Velcro—otherwise known as hook-and-loop in the industry.</p><p id="""">When you went to Madison Square Garden or Nassau Coliseum back in the day, you’d buy a $12 or $15 Mylar balloon with Elmo or Cookie Monster or Princess or whatever on it. By the time you got back to your seat, you’d look up at the ceiling and see every single balloon there.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And kids crying.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, there’s no reason to buy another balloon after intermission because all the kids are bawling and upset. So I came up with this wristband to keep my daughter’s balloon on the ribbon attached to the D-ring. You could take it on and off. It was also a weight, so the balloon wouldn’t fly away. You could easily put it on a wrist, belt buckle, or stroller without cutting off circulation. But again, that was something niche and a really inexpensive item.</p><p id="""">Fast forward to now, George. For example, during the pandemic, it was very difficult to get paper goods. I cherished every paper towel sheet.</p><p id="""">I looked at the top of the roll and realized it was dirty—dried up with orange juice or tomato sauce. I asked friends and family to send me pictures of their paper towel rolls, and it was disgusting.</p><p id="""">So I invented something I now have a patent for: a device that fits into the inner tube of the paper towel roll. When your hands are wet or dirty, you can pull the sheet off without dirtying the roll.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Advice for Aspiring Inventors</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I know that a lot of people now have really amazing ideas, but most everyone goes, ""Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if you could do this?"" But then they think, ""Ah, I could never... like, I could never get that done. Inventions are not something the average person can do.""</strong></p><p id="""">The first thing I say, George, is, ""Is it yours?"" I understand that you searched on Google on page one with your eyes closed because you didn’t want to find it.</p><p id="""">Or you went down the aisle of Walmart or your favorite store and said, ""Oh my gosh, it’s not out there. I’m going to be a gazillionaire. This is it. This is the one,"" right?</p><p id="""">But I would say that many people—and I tell this to pretty much everybody—need to do their research. Business owners and business people listening to this, no matter what you’ve done, you’ve done your research before you put your time, money, energy, and effort into it.</p><p id="""">And it’s the same thing with an invention or an idea for a business product—whatever you’re doing. You do your due diligence; you do your research. What’s going to make you different from anything else out there? Is it something you should put your time, money, energy, and effort into?</p><p id="""">I know it’s exciting. A lot of people make decisions based on their emotions and not based on facts or research. That’s one thing I always say, George.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. And we’re both marketers as well. So it’s funny because I say that to people a lot. They’re like, ""I’ve got this amazing idea,"" and they just go after it, spending money and doing whatever. I ask, ""Have you looked at what the competitors are doing? Have you done your market research? Have you done this or that?""</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s like measure twice, cut once, right? So I think that’s great, very wise advice. I think people will learn the more they get to know you that it’s not just an unrealistic thing to think you can make money with an invention or an idea, but it’s super smart to start in the right place.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Turning Ideas into Businesses</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So how do you take an idea and build a business around an invention? Could you help us make that a little more specific? How do you envision an idea becoming a business, and where do you start?</strong></p><p id="""">George, I’ve been an inventor for many years. Actually, being an inventor coach and going through this process, listening to people—it’s been over 18 years now.</p><p id="""">People have had successes. People have had failures, which are lessons learned and challenges. I’ve had the chance to listen to high-profile people, interview them, and learn from them. That has made me who I am today.</p><p id="""">When somebody comes to me with something, I can almost see where it’s going. But you know what? Every person, every product, every idea is different.</p><p id="""">When I talk to somebody, I figure out: Who are you? Is this something you’re doing as a side hustle while working full-time? Is this something you want to go all-in on as an entrepreneur? Or do you not have time, and you want someone else to manufacture and distribute it while you earn royalties?</p><p id="""">I think it’s really important to assess what you want to do and how you want to do it. That’s step one. Then I go back to where you are and help you get to where you want to go.</p><p id="""">So ultimately, the first thing—like we were talking about earlier—is to do your research. A patent search with a patentability opinion is always a good step, but do your research first before spending money on that.</p><p id="""">Then you want to figure out what it’s going to look like. I chicken-scratch a drawing or create something tangible. I used to take my daughter’s toys and rip them apart to create a prototype. I find existing items to make things easier along the way.</p><p id="""">I might hire an engineer or a prototyper and get the concept to a point where I feel good about it. At that point, I might want to protect it with a provisional patent application so it’s “patent pending,” or I might file a design patent if it’s ornamental. Otherwise, I’ll go for a utility, non-provisional patent application.</p><p id="""">There’s a lot of steps. Then I might want to trademark it. After all that, I’d ask: What’s next? Do I license it to earn royalties?</p><p id="""">People often say, “I want to sell my idea.” But what are you selling? You need intellectual property. If I came to you, George, and you owned a clothing company, and I showed you an idea with no IP, you wouldn’t need to pay me. You could just make it yourself, right?</p><p id="""">If I’m going to present something, I want to provide a competitive advantage in the market. I want to offer IP that someone can rent the rights to and, as they sell it, pay me royalties.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Understanding Patents and Trademarks</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">This is key. I want to pause you for one second because we talked about this before. For the people listening—business owners, entrepreneurs, CEOs, and high achievers—I want to make a clear distinction.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We’re not just talking about inventing something. We’re talking about creating a brandable asset, something profitable, something that builds your lifestyle. What I love about how Brian thinks is that he focuses on locking down value in the marketplace through legally binding and specific IP.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Sometimes people get confused between patents, trademarks, licensing, and things like that. Could you help us differentiate these and how they apply to businesses and ideas?</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. Let’s break it down.</p><p id="""">If we’re talking about patents, is it something that functions? For example, my collapsible egg tray.</p><p id="""">One night, I had no room in my fridge. I had a carton of eggs, and there was one egg left. That annoyed me. So I created a collapsible tray where, as you remove eggs, the tray takes up less space. I call it <em id="""">Extra Space.</em></p><p id="""">This is a utility patent because it has a function.</p><p id="""">On the other hand, there’s my <em id="""">Paper Towel Topper,</em> which is ornamental. That’s a design patent.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, let me clarify—if I have a logo, I can trademark it, and once it’s used in commerce, it becomes a registered trademark. But what about a system, like a seven-step process we take people through? Could that be patented, or is it something that would be copyrighted instead?</strong></p><p id="""">Great question! Each of those—trademarks, patents, copyrights—are distinct forms of intellectual property. A system might be eligible for a process patent, while a logo would fall under a trademark. Copyrights, on the other hand, protect creative works like books, music, or technical drawings.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Class of Goods and Trademark Protection</strong></h3><p id="""">Let’s take your Phoenix logo as an example. It’s trademarked within a certain class of goods or services. Now, if I wanted to use that same logo on milk cartons, I could potentially do that because it’s in a completely different class.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Interesting! That was going to be my next question. I have a registered trademark for both the Phoenix logo and the <em id="""">Daily Mastermind</em> brand. But does it make sense to register in multiple categories to avoid conflicts?</strong></p><p id="""">It really depends on your business. If your focus is apparel, for example, protect it there. If someone uses your logo in a non-competing category, like microphones, it’s unlikely to confuse consumers. That’s the key: consumer confusion.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What about domain names? Are they worth trademarking too?</strong></p><p id="""">Domain names themselves aren’t traditionally classified as intellectual property, but they can be an important part of your brand. Here’s what I recommend:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Secure the domain early.</li><li id="""">Consider registering the name as a word mark. A word mark gives you flexibility—you can apply it to various designs and logos without being locked into one specific look.</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a great point. I recently launched <em id="""">JoinTheEvolution.com</em> as the hub for my academy. Based on what you’re saying, I should think about trademarking the name itself, not just relying on the domain.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Word marks are versatile, and they ensure your brand name is protected across different mediums. A domain name alone won’t stop someone from using your name on a product.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s pivot a bit. For people out there with a great idea, one of the biggest challenges is emotional attachment. What advice do you have for balancing emotions with sound business decisions?</strong></p><p id="""">That’s a critical point. Inventors often get so attached to their ideas that they skip essential steps like research. Before you get too invested, ask:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Is it truly unique?</strong> Search patents, trademarks, and existing products.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Is there a market?</strong> Just because it excites you doesn’t mean it will sell.</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">And what about trust? Many inventors fear sharing their ideas.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s where Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) come in. Before discussing your idea with anyone, have them sign an NDA. It’s a simple yet powerful way to protect yourself.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Advice: Protecting and Scaling Your Ideas</strong></h3><p id="""">For those listening who have an idea but don’t know where to start, what’s your advice? Start with these steps:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Do your research. Make sure your idea is original and viable.</li><li id="""">Protect it early. File a provisional patent or register a trademark if needed.</li><li id="""">Think about your market. Who will buy this, and why?</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">And where can people find you if they want guidance?</strong></p><p id="""">The best place is my website,<a href=""https://www.brianfried.com"" id=""""> BrianFried.com</a>.

And now, when you say ""digital accounting firm,"" it's a pretty common idea—especially after COVID.</p><p id="""">But that was early on, in 2013. Nobody was really doing that.</p><p id="""">The industry I was in was a younger generation, all working remotely. We had a good reputation in that industry, so it was an easy entrance for me to start that firm. We started off with bookkeeping, partnered with tax people to whom we’d send our bookkeeping clients, and really got frustrated because I could never get a clear answer from those partners.</p><p id="""">I'd ask a tax planning question, like, ""How would our client do this?"" And they'd respond with, ""It depends."" I could never really get a clear answer.</p><p id="""">Eventually, that led me to do my own research, start doing taxes, and really find a love for the tax planning space, which is where we are now.</p><p id="""">The podcast started almost by accident. We were doing some YouTube videos on different tax strategies. One of our team members said, ""Hey, why don’t you try putting this on a podcast?""</p><p id="""">I wasn’t a podcast listener back then—this was a little over five years ago. But I thought, ""Okay, let’s try it."" We put three videos up, turned them into audio for a podcast.</p><p id="""">Six months later, someone reached out and said, ""Hey, I love your podcast. How do I work with you?"" And I thought, ""What podcast?"" I had no clue what they were even talking about.</p><p id="""">Then it clicked—oh yeah, we put those three videos up six months ago. That was our cue to start doing this. It really turned into a passion project. My goal is to help business owners understand the tax strategies available to them.</p><p id="""">So we started doing weekly episodes, creating videos with accompanying blog posts, and everything like that. That’s how we started growing from there.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s awesome. So what’s nice about your background is you come from business into accounting, and you have the mix of both, right? You understand the day-to-day workings and the operations of growing and scaling a business, which is great.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Tax Planning</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It brings up this topic that I’ve hit on a few times, and I know you’re a big advocate of distinguishing between tax preparation and tax planning, right? People think of ""my accountant"" and don’t realize, as they grow their wealth, they need a team of specialists. The tax code is so completely overwhelming that nobody could understand all of it anyway.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You, I feel, dig deep into areas you specialize in. Help us understand from your perspective the difference between tax planning and tax prep—and the importance of each.</strong></p><p id="""">Tax prep is obviously required by law. It’s just taking information, sending it to the IRS and state agencies. That gets done after the year ends.</p><p id="""">Tax planning, on the other hand, is what you do throughout the year—January to December—to ensure you’re paying the least amount of taxes legally possible. Then, when you meet your accountant in February or March, you’re simply taking that information and submitting it to the agencies.</p><p id="""">So many business owners don’t think about tax planning because they don’t get the answers they need. They might ask, ""How do I hire my kids?"" and get the answer, ""It depends."" That discourages them, and they walk away from the idea of tax planning.</p><p id="""">But whether you’re making $1,000 or $10 million a year, there are plenty of tax strategies that are easy to understand, fairly easy to implement, and completely legal.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a great distinction—planning versus preparing. And I feel like so many business owners don’t realize they could save significantly just by being proactive.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Maximizing Deductions: Strategies and Mindset</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So let’s get to the million-dollar question. Most people just want to know how to pay less taxes and maximize their deductions. I know we don’t have all the time in the world today, but where would someone start? Help us understand your mindset around maximizing deductions for businesses.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. This idea of maximizing deductions is exactly that—it’s a mindset shift. We have to walk business owners through it because many think of maximizing deductions as going out and buying things they don’t necessarily need, just to get a tax benefit.</p><p id="""">For example, a traditional accountant might say, ""It’s close to year-end, you should buy a truck and take some bonus depreciation."" The business owner might think, ""I don’t really need a truck, but if it helps with taxes, I guess I’ll get one.""</p><p id="""">That’s the common perception—buying things you don’t need to save taxes. But it doesn’t really make sense. If you buy a $100,000 truck, even if you’re in the highest tax bracket, you’re only saving a percentage of that cost in taxes. You’re still spending money you didn’t need to spend.</p><p id="""">When we talk about maximizing deductions, we want to shift the mindset. Instead of spending unnecessarily, we focus on how to take spending you’re already doing and turn it into pre-tax spending.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that distinction. It’s about turning after-tax spending into pre-tax spending. That’s a really important shift for business owners to understand. So, what are some examples or tips for how to do that?</strong></p><p id="""">One example is thinking about home office expenses. Let’s say you’re working from home and buy a desk, a chair, or a computer. As a W-2 worker, you don’t get any tax deductions for those items. But as a business owner, those same expenses can become pre-tax deductions.</p><p id="""">The IRS and Congress actually encourage business owners to use the tax code to their advantage. That’s one of the greatest advantages of being a business owner.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love the way you frame that. It’s about being intentional and proactive—thinking pre-tax, not after-tax. But some business owners worry about being ""too aggressive"" with deductions or triggering an audit. How do you handle that concern?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely, and it’s a common concern. Many business owners feel nervous about taking deductions, thinking it might be ""shady"" or risky. But the truth is, the tax code is written the way it is for a reason. It’s our job to take advantage of the opportunities it provides.</p><p id="""">The IRS isn’t going to advertise ways for you to save money—it’s up to us to dig into the code and apply it. If you’re following the rules, you have nothing to worry about. The key is documentation.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Documentation and Compliance</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, documentation is critical. Can you give some examples of what that looks like in practice?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Let’s say you’re going out to a meal with a client. That’s a valid business expense, but you need to document it. Write down who you met with, why you met with them, and keep the receipt. Take a picture of it and store it. You might never need it, but if the IRS comes knocking, you’ll be prepared.</p><p id="""">Another great example is hiring your kids. Many business owners support their kids financially. Why not turn that into a business deduction? But it’s not as simple as just writing them a check. They need to be doing actual work, earning a reasonable wage, and you need documentation—job descriptions, employment agreements, and records of hours worked.</p><p id="""">That way, if the IRS ever questions it, you have everything ready to back it up. Most of the time, you’ll never need it, but having that peace of mind helps business owners feel confident about taking deductions.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think you’re absolutely right. It’s about being prepared and having a plan. And the benefits of proactive tax planning go beyond just saving money—they compound over time.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Reducing your tax liability doesn’t just save you money—it gives you more to invest back into your business or other opportunities. Those savings can grow and multiply over time.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Resources and Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Mike, you’ve provided so much value today.

But he's the author of 25 books and the <em id="""">Seven Figure Machine: The Ultimate Roadmap to Endless Earnings and Financial Freedom.</em> So welcome to the show, Noah. How are you?</strong></p><p id="""">Great to be back seeing you again, George. It’s been a while.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it is. It is. And man, I tell you, I'm so excited because there's a lot of authors and experts out there nowadays with AI and everything going on, but very few have actually done what you've done, and very few—a lot of people can talk about it—but even fewer can actually help people do it. Your proven track record obviously speaks for itself.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Noah St. John's Background Story</strong></h3><p id="""">I grew up poor in a rich neighborhood, and I know that's a total cliché, but it's true. I grew up in this little town called Kennebunkport, Maine, which is one of the wealthiest communities in New England, but my family was dirt poor. And I mean that literally because we lived at the bottom of a dirt road in a drafty, unfinished house that my parents ended up losing to foreclosure when I was just 15 years old.</p><p id="""">You hear motivational speakers, they'll get on stage all the time, they'll say, ""We were poor, but we were happy. We didn’t know we were poor."" In my family, we freaking knew we were poor. My mother, bless her heart, reminded us every day that we were poor and miserable. So no, it wasn’t happy—it sucked.</p><p id="""">From a very young age, I was painfully exposed to the gap, the chasm between the haves and the have-nots. The haves were everyone else in the community; the have-nots were my family. And I hated being poor. I just hated that life of poverty, fear, lack, and not-enoughness. That’s what I grew up with.</p><p id="""">Because I saw that right down the street, there was great wealth and abundance. So I said from the time I was a little kid, ""How the heck can I get from here to there?"" Of course, there was no one who could help me. There was no internet back then, none of the things we have today. So I did the only thing I could think of—I went to the library and read every book in the self-help section.</p><p id="""">I just read every book: the classics, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, Stephen Covey, and I immersed myself in that successful literature. I really worked hard and tried to make it work, but as hard as I tried and worked, I just couldn’t seem to get it to work. At the age of 25, I was so frustrated. I’d been working so hard, but I was in these dead-end jobs. My girlfriend left me—it was like a country song, but it was really true. I decided to take my own life at age 25. I decided to commit suicide.</p><p id="""">At the very last moment, my life was spared, but I didn’t know why. So I said, ""I’ve got to find out what my purpose is here on Earth. Why am I here?"" These are questions humans have been asking for centuries. I didn’t know how to answer that question, so I said, ""Okay, I’ve got to go back to the library."" I did. This time, I read every book in the spiritual section and studied that. I just immersed myself in that literature.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Discovering the Missing Piece</strong></h3><p id="""">Then fast forward five years later, in 1997, I had these epiphanies when I realized exactly what was missing in all those books and all those seminars I spent years attending, and no one was talking about it. I realized, ""Aha, this is my message. This is my purpose."" So I wrote my first book, <em id="""">Permission to Succeed,</em> which was subsequently published by the Chicken Soup for the Soul publisher.</p><p id="""">Now, all these years later, I’m the only author in history—the only person—who has had works published by Hay House, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, Mindvalley, Nightingale-Conant, and the Chicken Soup for the Soul publisher. No one else in history has ever done that—I’m the only one.</p><p id="""">And now, as you mentioned, we have 25 books, and we’ve helped our clients add over $3 billion collectively. We’ve helped entrepreneurs, chiropractors, health professionals, network marketing professionals, wealth managers, and investors add literally six figures, seven figures, and even eight figures using my methods.</p><p id="""">As you mentioned, I’m known as the breakthrough coach—the person who helps people to make more in just 12 weeks than they did in the previous 12 months while actually winning their lives back. That’s really exciting. When you go to my website, you’ll see hundreds and hundreds of success stories and case studies. That’s how it really works.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Seven Figure Machine</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">And one of the things I’m excited today to talk about is the seven-figure machine book. We’re going to dive into the strategies, but before we set that up, I want our listeners to know this is why I relate so much to you, Noah. At the end of the day, we have very similar backgrounds. We had different things going on, but—guys, success leaves clues.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You notice Noah said he lived around wealth even though he wasn’t wealthy. So he was in that environment, and he knew it was possible. But the other thing is that he realized it was more than just the outer game—it was the inner game as well. That’s part of what got you and me connected.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It was more than just that outer success, and mindset became a big part of the equation. That’s why this podcast talks about mindset so often. I really want to talk to people today about the fact that you’re one of those rare individuals who figured out the real problem holding people back is mindset, but you also found ways to help people break through into financial success.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So why did you decide—look, you’ve got 25 books, you’ve been published more than anybody else in all these different areas—what made you decide to do this book, <em id="""">Seven Figure Machine?</em> What was the purpose behind it?</strong></p><p id="""">When I started my company, SuccessClinic.com, I was living in a 300-square-foot basement apartment in Hadley, Massachusetts. I had $800 to my name. I had no money, no connections, no marketing skills, no sales skills, no business acumen. The only funnels we had back then were funnel cake. So it was very rudimentary. It was like trying to build a house with a rock and some sticks. I had nothing.</p><p id="""">I didn’t have any resources, but I had resourcefulness. I realized I had this message that I had to bring to the world. It was my calling, but I didn’t know how the heck to do it. I had to spend what little money I had to learn how to make money online, put up a website, and eventually understand things like funnels and offers. I learned the hard way.</p><p id="""">The point is, I ended up spending over half a million dollars going to all these gurus out there, only to find out that they can’t teach their way out of a paper bag. They truly suck at teaching. What they’re great at is self-promotion and self-marketing. That’s why, if you notice, when you go to the gurus, their main, if not only, success story is themselves.</p><p id="""">They’ll say, ""Hey, look at my yacht. Look at my helicopter. Look at my jet. Aren’t I awesome?"" And it’s like, yeah, you’re awesome, dude, but have you helped anyone else make money? Usually, the answer is, not so much.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I will add to what you just said...A lot of times, those individuals' success comes from helping people—not in normal business. You learned through actual business, but now you also have case studies of helping people. That is critical when finding a mentor or someone to guide you.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Importance of Systems Over Personality</strong></h3><p id="""">And so the thing that I noticed in this industry is you have two camps: personality-driven success and system-driven success. Personality-driven success is exactly what it sounds like—it’s based on that person’s personality. But the question is, what if you don’t have that personality? Then guess what—you’re out of luck. That can’t be taught. You can’t get someone else’s personality.</p><p id="""">You can try to fake it, but it never works. So I realized I needed a system. I paid a lot of money for one but never got it. So I had to build it myself. I created the system that we now call the <em id="""">Seven Figure Machine.</em> It’s literally a fill-in-the-blank, plug-and-play, paint-by-numbers checklist system. That’s what I paid for and never got.</p><p id="""">Instead of vague advice like, ""Get your name out there,"" or ""Put out great content,"" I created an actionable checklist. My clients love that about me. They say, ""Noah, you just give us exactly what to do."" My pain is your gain—you’re welcome.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me ask you a question. I want to get into the strategy here in a second, but you said something I thought was really cool. A lot of people feel like, ‘I want to get to that seven-figure, eight-figure, nine-figure level, but I don’t have the personality of a CEO or high achiever.’ Now, as you progress and have more success, your confidence builds, but are you saying systems are as important—or more important—than personality?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes. W. Edwards Deming, the famous management guru, said, ""You put a good person in a bad system, and the system will win every time."" The reverse is also true: If you put an average person in a great system, the system still wins.</p><p id="""">The classic example is McDonald’s. There are no MBAs or PhDs there—it’s run by 16-year-old kids with a turnover rate of 700% a year. But McDonald’s is McDonald’s because of the system. That’s what I’ve done with the <em id="""">Seven Figure Machine.</em> I created a system that anyone can use.</p><p id="""">That’s why I’d rather brag about my client’s success than my own. Yes, I’ve done well, but who cares? It’s about the people I’ve helped. That’s how you know it’s a system that works.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Mindset and Speed in Business</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So let me ask you this. And I’m imagining you’re obviously interweaving mindset into everything you’re doing because, as we know, that’s probably the most important thing out there. But is it really possible for somebody to do more in 12 weeks than they’ve done in the last 12 months, as you talk about in the book? Because I think some people probably feel skeptical, you know what I mean?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Think about it this way: building a business is like building a house. There are a lot of elements involved. But here’s what happens—most entrepreneurs wake up in the morning and think, “Oh man, I need money. I need sales. What do I do?” So they run around, slapping boards together, hoping a house shows up.</p><p id="""">That’s not how you build a house—certainly not a good one. What I’ve given you in the <em id="""">Seven Figure Machine</em> is a blueprint. It’s a plan—a fill-in-the-blank system. I’m like the architect. But what I tell my clients is, ""It’s your house. I’m not going to live in it. Build something that works for you, not just because someone else said you should.""</p><p id="""">Here’s an example. A lot of gurus say, “If you’re not spending money on Facebook ads, you’re a loser.” I’ve had countless clients come to me saying, “Noah, I spent all this money on Facebook ads and lost money.” My first question is, “What were you sending traffic to?” And they’ll say, “My website.”</p><p id="""">Then I’ll ask, “What’s your offer? What’s your funnel?” And they’ll say, “I don’t have an offer yet or a funnel yet.” Isn’t that amazing? All they’re doing in that case is losing money. So my job is to back up and say, “Let’s start here, put everything in place step by step, and then you’ll have a house that’s actually livable.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, and you’re right. We have to give people some grace here because no one teaches you this stuff, right? You don’t automatically know you need an offer first or a strategy or a message. And the challenge with most gurus is that they skip right to the chase, hooking you on some idea like, ‘Do my real estate thing,’ or whatever. But the other issue is that many people are promoting someone else’s offer, not their own. And that’s critical. You need to understand and build your own offer.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. And this brings me to a major point: most people think, “I don’t have more time in the day to grow my business.” They’re overwhelmed and don’t want to sacrifice their lifestyle. But here’s the key—I teach my clients how to grow their business while actually improving their lifestyle.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Lifestyle and Scaling</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I know you’re great at this. So how do we create something that grows with better lifestyle integration, rather than sacrificing more time and energy?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, absolutely. That’s one of my big points. A lot of these so-called experts talk about hustle and grind. I call them the ""hustle bros."" They’re out there saying, “You’ve got to work 14, 16, 18 hours a day. And if you’re not working on Christmas Eve, you’re a loser.”</p><p id="""">I’m like, “Dude, are you crazy?” I want my business to serve me—not the other way around. I don’t want to live for my business. I want my business to exist to serve my lifestyle, my family, and what I want to do. The problem is most people don’t have the framework or structure to make that happen.</p><p id="""">Here’s an example. One of my clients, Tamisa, is a business owner in Arizona. She joined my 12-week breakthrough program, where I help people make more in 12 weeks than they did in the last 12 months—while also winning their lives back. She was very skeptical, even calling herself a “seminar junkie.” She was already making six figures but kept hitting an income ceiling.</p><p id="""">In just the first two weeks of the program, she tripled her investment. We hadn’t even gotten to the money part yet. That shows you how powerful a framework is. When you have the right structure, you can work less and make more. If you’re just slapping boards together, hoping something works, you’ll stay stuck.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And the irony is that some of the wealthiest people I know work fewer hours than most. They’ve learned to leverage systems and their time effectively. So it really is about shifting your mindset, as well as using the right tools. I know your system incorporates both. Is there a single mindset shift you feel is critical for becoming a successful, scalable entrepreneur?</strong></p><p id="""">It comes down to three words: money loves speed.</p><p id="""">A big problem for many entrepreneurs is the fear of failure, which is natural. No one wants to fail. But millions of entrepreneurs are waiting for everything to be perfect. They’re waiting for all the stars to align. The truth is, you can never know everything. That’s why General George Patton said, “A good plan violently executed today is better than a perfect plan executed next week.”</p><p id="""">I encourage my clients to fail faster. I tell them, “90% of what I’ve done over the last 27 years has failed. But the 10% that worked made it all worthwhile.” I say that on purpose because I want people to realize that if I can do it, so can they.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Strategic and Tactical Insights</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a great point. I love that you highlight the importance of speed and the willingness to fail. Let’s transition to some of the strategies you lay out in your <em id="""">Seven Figure Machine</em>. Could you share specific, tactical insights or steps people can start applying in their businesses right now?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. The <em id="""">Seven Figure Machine</em> is structured around six essential steps that are critical to building a scalable business. Here’s the overview:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Seven Figure Offer Secrets<br></strong>This is about creating a compelling, irresistible offer that resonates with your target audience. It’s the foundation of everything else.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Seven Figure Product Secrets<br></strong>Here we focus on delivering value through your product or service in a way that keeps customers coming back.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Seven Figure Cash Machine Secrets<br></strong>This is all about building predictable, recurring revenue streams to ensure cash flow stability.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Seven Figure List Building Secrets<br></strong>Your email list is your most valuable asset. I teach you how to grow it strategically and convert leads into loyal customers.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Seven Figure Client Attraction Secrets<br></strong>This step is about bringing in the right clients who are ready to invest in your product or service.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Seven Figure Scaling Secrets<br></strong>Finally, I show you how to scale your business without sacrificing your lifestyle.</li></ol><p id="""">These steps apply whether you’re just starting out, have been in business for a while, or are trying to break through to the next level.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a really comprehensive roadmap. And I think what stands out is that these are foundational elements—things people might overlook in favor of trendy tactics. Could you give us an example of someone who’s applied these steps and seen success?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Let me tell you about one of my clients, Charles. When we first talked, I asked him, “How much money do you think you’re losing every year by not having the right systems in place?” Without hesitation, he said, “At least a million dollars.”</p><p id="""">I said, “Great. Why don’t you invest 10% of that million with me, and I’ll help you find the rest?” He agreed, and within just 10 months, we didn’t find him a million dollars—we found him 1.8 million. That’s an 18X return on his investment.</p><p id="""">More importantly, he told me, “Noah, I’ve always wanted to take a seven-week road trip in an RV with my wife, but I never had the time or the money to do it. Now I have both.” That’s the power of having the right framework in place.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts and Call to Action</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think what you’ve shared today is so valuable.

I'm joined by a great topic. This is going to be really fun.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I'm joined by Spencer Howard, and I'm going to give you a quick background on him. He's a credit card loyalty and travel reward expert. He's the founder of a company called Straight to the Points, and he teaches strategies behind how to use your business card to create a luxury travel lifestyle.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But he's been a travel writer and editor for over a decade, featured on podcasts and outlets. What I loved about when I saw his background is he travels three months per year to 60-plus countries. So welcome to the podcast, Spencer. How are you?</strong></p><p id="""">Thanks so much for having me. I'm doing well.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, this is great. This is a good topic because, as people know me, they know I'm all about mindset and business and money, but lifestyle is the whole point of it.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Spencer Howard's Background and Journey</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So tell us a little bit about your story. I'm curious about your background, but more importantly, what settled you into this niche of luxury travel?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, for sure. I actually used to work in politics, everybody's favorite industry. It’s crazy, but towards the end of that, I picked up reading a blog about points. I was like, “Oh, points? What are points?” I dove into it, and the guy was like, “Oh, I fly business class with points.”</p><p id="""">I thought, “I’m six-three. I’d love to lie down.” I think I had just booked a flight to Japan in economy, and my knees were going to be in the back of the seat in front of me. I needed to do this better. That was the jumping-off point for me.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Had you been traveling already? Your whole life? Or not really?</strong></p><p id="""">Not a ton, but it was something I always wanted to do. When you work in politics, you don’t really get a lot of time off. It’s all on the work side, not a lot of lifestyle. Towards the end of my time in politics, I started having a little more time to travel, and I just made figuring out the best ways to do it a priority.</p><p id="""">I spent four hours a night for six months learning everything you could never want to know about airline programs and credit card fine print. Now I basically just say, “You don’t need to do that. I’ll do it for you.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s awesome. And this is credit card travel, but you’ve been blogging and writing. Was that writing and blogging in this particular topic that you were learning, studying, and growing on?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, about nine months after I got really into this, I started writing part-time, just freelancing. I picked up enough writing to leave my previous job and start a new career path. It was all educational writing. I’d say I’m not very good at clickbait, but I’m really good at breaking down complex topics and making them understandable. That’s been my focus, and it’s what I still do now with my email newsletter.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Turning Passion into a Business</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">At what point did this turn from an interest to a business for you? What made you decide, “I like this. I want to make this a business”? Because at the end of the day, I’m sure a lot of people are like, “There’s a lot of things I’d like to do; I’m going to study them, really get into them, maybe even write—but how do I monetize it?” So, at what point did it turn into a business, and did you see initially that there was an opportunity with it? Or was it just, “I think I can do this, and I want to focus my time on it”?</strong></p><p id="""">At first, it was freelance writing. I just had contracts with different sites to write for them, and that was easy enough. I guess about two years after I started writing, I started my email newsletter as a hobby.</p><p id="""">I think I was looking for a flight and noticed something rare—an opportunity to use points for a business class flight. I mentioned it to a friend of mine. I said, “I do all this research for the articles I’m writing. I should just send emails out when I find something worth booking.” He was like, “Do it right now. I’ll sign up. Do it.”</p><p id="""">I started an email list the next day.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s great. And it’s really funny you say that because I think a lot of people dabble. I’ve got this interest; I do some things. But I’m going to make an interesting point to the listeners: four hours a night for six months. You really studied it. You got to know it. You went deep, right? I think most people dabble when they should go deep.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And then, a couple of years of freelance writing, you decided to do a newsletter. Why did you choose a newsletter? Just because you were already a writer and thought, “That’s a great way for me to kick out my ideas”?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, it’s funny because I remember in 2018 hearing people say, “Oh, email newsletters are dead.” I thought, “Okay, that’s fine. I like blogging.” This felt a bit more curated. I’m only going to talk to people who are interested in what I’m interested in.</p><p id="""">You’re not signing up for my newsletter if you don’t care about flying business or first class, or traveling abroad. It was a way to ensure I was reaching people who had committed to me. It gave them an advantage over others who weren’t aware of these opportunities.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think that’s great. And it’s really interesting because I always love interviews like this. It shows that success is pretty consistent, and principles are consistent. You found something you were passionate about, worked on it, went deep, and focused your time. You also drilled down into a niche.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">When it comes to luxury travel, was that because you saw the opportunity, or because it was what you were focused on personally, so you decided to stay in that vein?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, for me, it started because I love flying. If I can make the journey fun, that seemed like an awesome way to do it. This is just what I cared about and what I was interested in doing.</p><p id="""">I would still be supportive of someone who wants to use points to fly economy around the world. That’s great, have at it! But for me, I like flying. I thought it would be fun to have champagne while flying, to lie down, nap, have a better meal, and go to a nice airport lounge.</p><p id="""">That’s what mattered to me. Not everyone cares about that, and that’s great, but this is my little circle.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And you and I talked a little bit about this. Not everybody believes they can do it. I think many don’t believe they could ever afford it or have enough money on their credit card to make it happen. Plus, I don’t think they know where to start or even if it’s possible. Have you run into that? What do you say to someone who doesn’t think it’s possible?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Strategies for Maximizing Credit Card Points</strong></h3><p id="""">Yeah, I think, especially with points and credit cards, people often see credit cards as dangerous. I’ll readily admit they can be, but only if you’re not in a good financial position or not responsible with your finances.</p><p id="""">I always say this is an extra to enhance your life—it’s not the key to your life. If you don’t have a 700+ credit score, maybe even 720+, if you don’t pay your credit cards on time every time, or if you feel tempted to overspend because you have available credit, this isn’t the world for you.</p><p id="""">That’s fine. I just don’t want anyone to experience financial hardship because they decided to play a game. In the end, this is a game. It’s fun.</p><p id="""">But after that, it’s about piecing together a strategy. It’s like a puzzle: Which credit cards work best for you based on your spending habits? Many cards have bonus categories that earn two, three, or four points per dollar instead of one. It’s just about finding a strategy that fits your interests, time, and energy.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. That’s the case in point for so much in life: intentionality. I also agree—this isn’t about encouraging people to use credit cards irresponsibly. It’s about leveraging a strategy. You said something interesting: This is a game, but it’s a strategic game. It sounds like you’ve really hacked the model to fit for people.</strong></p><p id="""">It’s not a game for winging it. You can be spontaneous with it—book a last-minute trip when you find a ticket you can book with points. That’s fun. I’ve booked a flight six hours before departure and gone to Europe.</p><p id="""">But to get there, spreadsheets have been involved. I’m really good at tracking things, and a lot of people in this space are. We’re very aware of where we’re spending, how much our annual fees are, and whether we’re getting more value from a credit card than its annual fee. We’re constantly thinking 10 moves ahead.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That makes sense. For someone thinking about getting into luxury travel with credit card points, are there certain spending levels that make it feasible? Or is it more about applying a strategy, regardless of spending levels?</strong></p><p id="""">If you’re spending around $1,000 to $1,500 a month, you can probably do something meaningful. But it all comes down to your level of interest.</p><p id="""">I usually say there are three strategies with credit cards. First, there’s the “set it and forget it” approach. You get one to three cards with bonus categories that earn the most points on your spending. A lot of business owners do this.</p><p id="""">Then, there’s the “add-on” approach, where you start with four to six credit cards and supplement with a new one every few months.</p><p id="""">Finally, there’s the maximalist approach, where you repeatedly get new credit cards. It’s the most work, but you’ll earn the most points. Each new card comes with a sign-up bonus—for example, spend $4,000 in three months, and earn 75,000 points. That’s the fastest way to accumulate points.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Got it. Is this about the credit cards themselves or the companies you’re transferring points to, like airlines and hotels? What’s more important?</strong></p><p id="""">My main focus is on transferable or flexible points. Banks like Chase, Amex, Citi, Capital One, and Bilt have programs where you can transfer points to partner airlines or hotels.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Got it. So transferable points open up more options and flexibility compared to sticking with just one airline or hotel chain? That makes sense. Explain a little more about why transferable points are such a great strategy.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Transferable points give you access to more flights, more airlines, and better opportunities. For example, if you only have American Airlines miles, you’re limited to flying American Airlines or their OneWorld partners. Similarly, if you only have United miles, you’re limited to their Star Alliance partners.</p><p id="""">But with transferable points—say, Chase Ultimate Rewards—you can transfer your points to British Airways, which is a OneWorld partner like American. Or you could transfer them to Air Canada’s Aeroplan program, which is a Star Alliance member, or to Air France/KLM’s Flying Blue program, which is part of SkyTeam.</p><p id="""">So with one hub of points, you have access to almost every major airline in the world. This opens up tons of opportunities.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s huge because most people don’t realize how limiting single-airline loyalty programs can be. So with transferable points, you’re essentially leveraging arbitrage between programs?</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly! And here’s another example to illustrate the value of transferable points. Let’s say you’re booking a one-way business-class ticket to Europe. If you use Flying Blue (Air France/KLM’s program), it might cost you 50,000 miles and a couple of hundred dollars in taxes and fees.</p><p id="""">If you tried booking the same flight with Delta SkyMiles, it could cost you 150,000 to 300,000 miles for the same route, even though Delta partners with Air France/KLM. That’s why it’s so important to compare programs.</p><p id="""">By using transferable points, you can pick the program that gives you the best value for the flight you want.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a game-changer. I’ve definitely run into the frustration of limited award space with certain airlines, so having options is critical. How do you help clients avoid that frustration?</strong></p><p id="""">Award space is always going to be a bit of a challenge because airlines only release a certain number of seats for points bookings. But when you have transferable points, you can search across multiple programs to find availability.</p><p id="""">For example, let’s say I’m flying from DC to Europe. If there’s no award space on United or its Star Alliance partners, I could check Air France/KLM through Flying Blue or even British Airways.</p><p id="""">Having options is key. That’s why I focus on helping people understand which programs work best for different destinations.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And you mentioned earlier that some people might think this is a lot of work. What do you say to those who feel overwhelmed by the process?</strong></p><p id="""">It can feel overwhelming at first, but that’s why I focus on simplifying it. I have a quick-start guide on my website to help people understand the basics. Once you know the foundational principles—like which airlines partner with which programs—it becomes much easier.</p><p id="""">I also send out a newsletter where I highlight specific award space opportunities. For example, I’ll send the exact dates when you can book business-class flights with points and break down which programs give you the best value.</p><p id="""">Having someone curate this information for you saves a ton of time and energy.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Making Travel Simple and Accessible</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. So it’s about creating a system that simplifies the process and makes it easier for people to take advantage of these opportunities. What are some common myths or misconceptions people have about using credit card points for luxury travel?</strong></p><p id="""">One of the biggest misconceptions is that having multiple credit cards will ruin your credit score. In reality, if you’re managing your cards responsibly—paying your balances in full and on time—it can actually improve your credit score.</p><p id="""">Another misconception is that luxury travel is out of reach. People think they could never afford to fly business class or stay in five-star hotels, but with points, it’s absolutely possible.</p><p id="""">The key is to change your mindset. Instead of thinking, “I can’t afford this,” think, “How can I make this work?”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a good point. It’s all about mindset and strategy. I love that you make this accessible for people, whether they’re casual travelers or hardcore points enthusiasts. What’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone just starting out?</strong></p><p id="""">Start with transferable points. Get a good credit card that earns points you can transfer to multiple programs. That’s the easiest way to give yourself flexibility and options.</p><p id="""">And don’t feel like you have to master everything overnight. Just focus on understanding the basics, and as you gain experience, you’ll start to see how everything fits together.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion and Resources</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">This has been such an eye-opening conversation. I know our listeners are going to get so much value out of this. Before we wrap up, can you remind everyone where they can connect with you and get your resources?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely!

From AI-driven automation to viral marketing hacks, many business leaders are searching for a shortcut to the finish line. However, as industry veteran and FinTech pioneer <strong>Jed Morley</strong> shared in a recent sit-down on the <em>Authority Formula Podcast</em>, the most successful leaders aren't the ones with the best tools—they are the ones with the clearest foundation.</p><p>Success isn't found in a vacuum of planning; it’s forged in the fire of execution and the depth of human connection.</p><h3><strong>1. The Principle of Radical Execution</strong></h3><p>The biggest barrier to growth is often ""paralysis by analysis."" We wait for the perfect business plan or the ideal market conditions before we take the leap. But the truth of entrepreneurship is simpler: <strong>Clarity follows execution.</strong></p><p>You cannot steer a parked car. It is only through movement—making mistakes, pivoting, and adjusting in real-time—that the path forward becomes visible. If you are waiting for the ""perfect moment"" to launch or scale, you’ve already fallen behind. Execution isn't just a step in the process; it is the process itself.</p><h3><strong>2. Investing in Relationship Capital</strong></h3><p>We often talk about financial capital, but in the world of high-level business, <strong>Relationship Capital</strong> is the far more valuable currency.</p><p>Whether you are navigating the complexities of payment processing or building a brand from the ground up, your network is your net worth. Relationships built on trust, credibility, and mutual value survive market downturns and technological shifts. Authentic leadership means being the person people <em>want</em> to do business with, not just the person who has the best price.</p><h3><strong>3. The Anchor of Personal Responsibility</strong></h3><p>Prosperity is built on four pillars, but the most vital is the mindset of <strong>Personal Responsibility.</strong> In a digital age where AI can generate content in seconds, it is tempting to lose sight of the ""who"" behind the ""what.""</p><p>If you aren't clear on who you are and what you stand for, no amount of technology will save your business. True authority comes from internal alignment—knowing your values and ensuring your business actions reflect them every single day.</p><h3><strong>Real-World Example: From the Woods to the Boardroom</strong></h3><p>Consider the journey of those who have transitioned from manual labor to executive leadership. The grit required to fell trees in the Alaskan wilderness is the same grit required to navigate a multi-million dollar FinTech merger.</p><p>One story shared in the podcast reminds us that the ""work"" isn't just about the tasks on your desk; it's about the character you build along the way. Whether it’s solving a ""five-day float"" issue for Shopify merchants or building trust with a global icon like Kathy Ireland, the common denominator is always the same: <strong>Show up, solve the problem, and keep your word.</strong></p><h3><strong>Action Steps: Building Your Authority</strong></h3><p>Ready to move the needle? Here are three micro-actions you can take today:</p><ul><li><strong>Commit to the 1% Rule:</strong> Don’t try to overhaul your life in 24 hours. Identify one ""micro-thing"" you can improve today in your business or personal habits. Consistency over time creates an unstoppable compound effect.</li><li><strong>Audit Your Circle:</strong> Reach out to one person in your network today with no agenda other than to add value. Nurture your relationship capital before you need to spend it.</li><li><strong>Execute One ""Pending"" Task:</strong> Find that one project you’ve been overthinking and take the first imperfect step. Stop planning and start doing.</li></ul><h3><strong>Conclusion and Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Success is a marathon, not a sprint. While the tools of the trade—AI, automation, and analytics—are powerful, they are merely amplifiers of the person using them. By focusing on execution, prioritizing relationships, and maintaining a growth mindset, you don't just build a business; you build a legacy.</p><p>Remember: It is never too late to start living the life you were meant to lead, but it requires you to take action today.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>About George Wright III:</strong></h4><p>George Wright is a Proven, Successful Entrepreneur- and he knows how to inspire entrepreneurs, companies, and individuals to achieve Massive Results.

George Wright III here with your daily dose of inspiration, motivation, and education. If this is your first time listening, you’re in for a treat. We’ve got an amazing guest here today. I don’t do a ton of interviews, but we’re going to roll out some more, and this one is really special.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’ve handpicked someone who I feel will bring incredible value to you today. Our podcast is all about masterminding—bringing together people who think alike, people who want to evolve and take their lives to the next level. Nicole, who I’m about to introduce, is the perfect example of that. Let me give her a quick introduction before we dive in.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Nicole Kernohan is a high-performance coach and the Chief Operating Officer of a rather large coaching company. I chose her to come on the podcast today because she trains and empowers entrepreneurs to scale their lives, create breakthroughs, and drive transformation. Not only that, but she also understands the systems and processes needed to make it happen.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We’re going to dig into a lot of her background and strategies today. Nicole Kernohan, how are you? Welcome to the show.</strong></p><p id="""">Thank you so much for having me. I’m great.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it took a little coordination to get this done, but here we are—two planets aligning! Let’s dig in. I just gave listeners a quick snapshot of what you do, but I’d love for you to share your story. Not just what you do, but how you got here. It’s an important and inspiring story. I think people will appreciate understanding the foundation for why you entered the space of personal development, transformation, and business growth.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Nicole's Personal Journey with MS</strong></h3><p id="""">Absolutely. I actually started with a degree in business and entered the corporate world in strategy and operations. However, my health experience 21 years ago really shifted my trajectory.</p><p id="""">I had an episode where I became paralyzed on the right side of my body—my right arm and leg. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). It completely knocked me off track. I was young, and it came out of nowhere.</p><p id="""">The interesting thing about that moment, which ties into why I do what I do today, is that I heard the doctor say, “You may or may not regain functionality. You may remain paralyzed; we hope you won’t, but we can’t guarantee it.” They explained that MS is typically degenerative.</p><p id="""">But here’s the thing: I heard the diagnosis, but I did not accept the prognosis. The prognosis was their expectation of my potential outcome with this disease. My family thought I was naive. They assumed I didn’t understand the doctor or that I was in denial.</p><p id="""">But I asked myself, “What even is false hope?” Anyone who has experienced miracles or achieved significant accomplishments had hope. It wasn’t false. My family cared about me, of course, and they didn’t want me to get my hopes up just to be disappointed.</p><p id="""">But because I refused to accept their prognosis, I did whatever it took. I sought advice from nutritionists, naturopaths, and medical practitioners. I never hit a point where I thought, “I’ve done everything; nothing is going to work.”</p><p id="""">Long story short, I healed. MS doesn’t have a cure, so I still have lesions on my brain scans, but I’ve been symptom-free for 20 years. That experience deeply shaped me. It made me want to help people on a deeper level—not just with their health, but in other areas like business and life transformation.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Mindset and Overcoming Obstacles</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a huge story. I want to highlight something for our listeners. Everyone faces major obstacles—maybe not as significant as an MS diagnosis, but obstacles nonetheless. What really stands out to me is that it’s not about the obstacle itself; it’s about how you respond to it.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Stephen Covey talks about the space between stimulus and response, where we can choose how to act. You chose to be proactive. You didn’t listen to the naysayers. You chose to find solutions—through fitness, nutrition, and whatever else it took. But I’m curious, were you always a naturally positive person, or was there something in your upbringing or environment that shaped that mindset?</strong></p><p id="""">A little bit of both, I’d say. I’ve always been generally optimistic and positive, but I also credit my upbringing. My parents were optimistic, and that definitely influenced me.</p><p id="""">But, you know what else? I realized something just now. I also did martial arts for ten years before my MS diagnosis. That training created a mental toughness and a “mind-over-body” mindset. I didn’t fully understand it at the time, but those years of programming prepared me for challenges like this.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow, that’s an incredible insight. Martial arts gave you that mental toughness early on. A lot of people don’t realize the foundational things they’ve done in their lives that prepare them for the bigger obstacles ahead.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s funny because we’re all creating our foundation, whether we realize it or not. Rituals, training, surrounding yourself with the right people—those things build resilience. And the best part? They’re all within your control.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Transition to Business and Entrepreneurship</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You mentioned martial arts, your positive mindset, and finding solutions. Those elements clearly shaped your response to MS. But your health journey eventually transitioned into entrepreneurship. Take us through that pivot—how did you go from focusing on health and nutrition to running a business?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, absolutely. After my health journey, I believed my purpose was to help others with health and nutrition. I had a business background, and my parents owned retail franchises, so entrepreneurship wasn’t foreign to me. My first step into entrepreneurship was opening a health-focused retail business.</p><p id="""">I wanted to transform people’s health, just like I had transformed mine. At the time, I thought it was my life’s purpose. But what I realized fairly quickly—and ignored for a while, maybe out of persistence or stubbornness—was that I could give people all the tools they needed, but many wouldn’t follow through.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You mentioned that to me before, and it stuck with me. People know what to do, but there’s a gap between knowing and doing. Why do you think that is?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s the “knowing-doing gap,” and it’s very real. People know what to do, but they don’t do it. That’s because their deeper, subconscious programming holds them back. At the time, I didn’t know how to address that gap, but it became clear that nutrition and fitness weren’t enough.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s fascinating because I think so many people can relate to that struggle—knowing what to do but not doing it. So, what helped you bridge that gap for yourself and others?</strong></p><p id="""">It happened by chance. I stumbled into positive psychology through a three-day seminar with Bob Proctor. That seminar was life-changing.</p><p id="""">It felt like I had been living in the dark, and someone turned on the lights. I thought, “How did I not know this? Why didn’t I learn this in school?” I realized most people don’t know it either. Positive psychology helped me connect the dots. I could finally understand how my subconscious beliefs, self-image, and habits had contributed to my healing.</p><p id="""">It also gave me tools to help others address the deeper issues—the limiting beliefs, fears, and hesitations that were holding them back. Positive psychology became the missing link between knowing and doing.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Mindset: The Root of Success</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a critical point. You’ve hit on something that I believe is the foundation for all success: mindset. Like T. Harv Eker says, “People want the fruits, but they don’t realize it’s the roots that create the fruits.” Your inner world creates your outer world. Your thoughts create your life. Most people don’t realize that, or they don’t know how to tap into it.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, what do you think holds people back the most? Why don’t they create the change they say they want?</strong></p><p id="""">It all comes down to subconscious programming. Studies show that 93–97% of our actions are driven by the subconscious mind, not the conscious mind.</p><p id="""">People might consciously say, “I want to grow my business” or “I want to break this habit.” But if their subconscious programming tells them, “You’re not good enough,” “You’ll never succeed,” or “This isn’t who you are,” then they’ll sabotage themselves.</p><p id="""">Their autopilot is set to keep them stuck. And most of that programming happens early in life, through childhood experiences and societal conditioning. That’s why so many people struggle—they’re trying to consciously change something, but their subconscious mind is working against them.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such an important insight. And I think a lot of people listening might feel overwhelmed by the idea of reprogramming their subconscious mind. But I know you have practical strategies and tips for getting started. Can you share a few?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Here are a couple of powerful strategies:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Morning Routine:<br></strong>The first 10–15 minutes of your day are critical. When you wake up, your mind is highly impressionable. If you don’t consciously choose how to start your day, you’ll likely default to the thoughts and feelings of yesterday.<br>Use this time to practice gratitude, meditate, or visualize your goals. Avoid checking your email or social media first thing in the morning—it pulls you into autopilot mode. Instead, set a positive tone for the day with intentional habits.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Repetition:<br></strong>Repetition is key to reprogramming the subconscious mind. If you hear an inspiring message or read something impactful, don’t just consume it once. Listen to it repeatedly. Read it every day. Repetition helps embed new beliefs and ideas into your subconscious.<br>For example, if you find a podcast or an audio message that empowers you, listen to it daily. Over time, it will become part of your mental framework, and you’ll start to internalize those empowering thoughts.</li></ol><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion and Resources</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love those tips. Morning routines and repetition are powerful tools. They’re simple but incredibly effective for creating lasting change. Nicole, thank you so much for sharing your story and your wisdom.

This interview is going to be a little different—we’re going to dig into some strategies as well as background. I want to introduce you to Jamie and give you a little bit of her background before we dive in.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">She’s a world-class business leader—a speaker, coach, and elite business development expert. Jamie has two decades of experience driving business innovation. She’s been the co-founder of Market Area Real Estate Services Franchise, one of Market Magazine’s Top 100 Franchise Concepts.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Between her elite knowledge of Infusionsoft (now Keap) and her ability to partner with industry giants, she has a wealth of expertise. Currently, she’s the CEO of Riff Social, helping clients harness the power of automation and social media ads for sales and marketing. Jamie, I’m thrilled to have you here today.</strong></p><p id="""">I am doing marvelous. Thank you so much for having me. I love what you’re doing with this podcast and how you’re helping people. I’m honored to be here.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Journey to Business and Marketing</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I know we’ve crossed paths over the years, and it’s clear to me that you know your stuff when it comes to business. For those who might not know your background, what got you into the business and marketing world? Were you always an entrepreneur, or did you gradually find your way into it?</strong></p><p id="""">I gradually got into it. I started out in the late eighties, early nineties—yeah, I’ve been around for a while. Actually, prior to that, I got my bachelor’s degree in Information Technology, which today would be called programming.</p><p id="""">And I earned my master’s degree in Marketing.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s an incredible combination.</strong></p><p id="""">I always tease, if Al Gore invented the internet, I invented digital marketing.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">There you go. Well, that’s amazing. Let’s talk about your early career. What were you doing before starting your own business?</strong></p><p id="""">Before the internet even existed, I was in Washington, DC, selling hardware and software. I sold IBMs and Compaq computers to government contractors. We called them the Beltway Bandits.</p><p id="""">I was handling deals worth $2 million, $5 million for 386s, 486s, and Compaq portables. Remember those massive machines?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oh, I remember them! We’re so spoiled now with the computers we carry in our pockets. So, you had a successful career, but at what point did you decide to start your own business? What led to that transition?</strong></p><p id="""">After 9/11, I was in the DC area, and my daughter’s school started planning for potential attacks. They were asking for supplies to quarantine the kids in case of emergencies. I thought, “No way. I want out of this rat race.”</p><p id="""">We moved to Hilton Head, South Carolina, and I began consulting. That’s when I met a gentleman who had started Market Area Real Estate Services—a unique real estate concept.</p><p id="""">He brought me on as a consultant and later made me COO, and eventually, CEO of the franchise corporation. I wrote the franchise documents, built the business, and we even had a $3 million IPO on Wall Street.</p><p id="""">But in January 2007, I was diagnosed with a massive brain tumor. I had to step away from the business for six months to focus on my health.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Overcoming Challenges</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. That must have been an incredibly difficult time. How did you process that diagnosis? You were on a successful trajectory, and then suddenly, your life changed. What was your mindset during that period?</strong></p><p id="""">The doctor told me I had less than six months to live. My daughter was ten, and my twins were six. I said to the doctor, “I have kids. I’m not abandoning them. That’s not an option. What are my choices?”</p><p id="""">He told me surgery was my only option, but with the size of my tumor, I had less than a 20% chance of surviving. He suggested I get my affairs in order and enjoy my last months.</p><p id="""">I looked at him and said, “Nope. I’ll take option C.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Option C? What do you mean by that?</strong></p><p id="""">He said, “There is no option C.” And I replied, “Sure there is. You’re going to do the surgery, I’m going to survive, and I’m going to see my kids grow up and get married.”</p><p id="""">One of my twins got married last March.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That is absolutely inspiring. It sounds like you created your own path forward when the odds were stacked against you. I imagine that experience shaped your approach to business and life. Did that situation lead you to focus on systems and automation?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. When I had to step away from the business, even though I’d written the franchise manual, we hadn’t put systems in place for running the corporate headquarters. It was 2007, and real estate was crashing. The business failed while I was out.</p><p id="""">That experience got me laser-focused on creating systems and automating processes. I wanted to build a business that supported my life—not the other way around.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a powerful insight. Most people build their lives around their businesses, but you flipped the script. So, is that when you started diving into automation and eventually worked with Infusionsoft (now Keap)?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, exactly. I started in web design and building systems. Infusionsoft kept trying to recruit me to promote their product, but at the time, it was $400 a month. I thought, “My small-business clients won’t spend that.”</p><p id="""">One day, I sat down with someone from their team, saw what it could do, and realized it made sense. I built my own system first, so I could start going to soccer games, take vacations, and enjoy holidays without stressing over deadlines.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Selling Results, Not Products</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It sounds like that was a turning point for you. You started creating systems not just for yourself but also for your clients. What did you find was the biggest struggle for entrepreneurs when it came to adopting automation tools like Keap?</strong></p><p id="""">One of the founders of Keap, Scott Martineau, once interviewed me after I became one of their top salespeople. He asked, “How do you sell Keap?”</p><p id="""">I looked at him and said, “Scott, I don’t sell Keap.” His face dropped—he probably thought, “Why am I interviewing her?”</p><p id="""">Then I explained, “I sell the results they get with Keap.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s brilliant. Selling the result instead of the product itself—it’s such a simple yet powerful shift.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. People don’t buy products; they buy outcomes. They don’t care if it’s Keap, Salesforce, or something else. As long as it delivers the result they’re looking for, that’s what matters.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a great philosophy. Let’s pivot to what you’re doing now. You’ve had incredible success with automation and Keap, but you’ve recently taken on the role of CEO at Riff Social. What led you to make that move?</strong></p><p id="""">I’ve always focused on email marketing, funnels, and content creation, but I stayed away from paid social media ads because they were complicated, expensive, and often didn’t deliver results.</p><p id="""">When I met Bill Hillestad, Riff Social’s visionary founder, he showed me how we could use automation and AI to make social media ads accessible and effective.</p><p id="""">We help businesses get thousands of real views on their content for a fixed monthly price—no surprise charges, no wasted ad spend. It’s about using the tools to build authority and reach the right audience.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That sounds incredible. Many entrepreneurs struggle with organic reach or navigating paid ads. How does Riff Social bridge that gap?</strong></p><p id="""">We use AI in conjunction with Meta’s algorithm to find the perfect audience. Instead of telling Facebook who we think should see your content, we let the content itself attract the right people.</p><p id="""">We run two types of ads for every post:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Video Validation Ads</strong> – These drive 5,000–10,000 views to your post immediately, building credibility and authority.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Targeted Ads</strong> – These show your post to the ideal audience, ensuring you’re reaching people who are likely to engage.</li></ol><p id="""">When someone engages with your post—whether they watch, like, comment, or share—we tag them as part of your audience. Then, we retarget them with future posts, keeping your brand in front of them consistently.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Building Authority Through Consistency</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a smart strategy—focusing on validation and targeting. How quickly can businesses start seeing results with Riff Social? Is it a long-term process like traditional organic growth?</strong></p><p id="""">Not at all. From the moment you sign up, your first post will start getting 5,000–10,000 real views. It’s immediate.</p><p id="""">Of course, building trust and authority takes multiple touches. In today’s noisy market, you need 15–30 interactions to really connect with your audience. That’s why we retarget engaged users, ensuring they see your content consistently.</p><p id="""">For example, if you’re a real estate agent, someone might not be ready to buy a house today. But after seeing your posts over several weeks, they’ll remember you when they—or someone they know—needs your services.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It sounds like video plays a big role in your strategy. Why is video so important?</strong></p><p id="""">Video content generates more engagement than static posts. When people see a video with thousands of views, it validates your authority and makes them more likely to watch.</p><p id="""">For instance, if you see a video with only two views, you might scroll past it. But if it has 5,000 views, you think, “This must be important.”</p><p id="""">By using our system, your posts gain immediate credibility, and that drives more engagement from your target audience.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">This approach seems like a game changer for small businesses. Many entrepreneurs struggle with time and resources. How does automation help them overcome these challenges?</strong></p><p id="""">Automation is essential for freeing up your time and ensuring consistency. Most business owners are so busy running their businesses that they don’t have time to manage social media effectively.</p><p id="""">With Riff Social, you just create your content, and we handle the rest. We automate the ads, audience targeting, and retargeting so you can focus on what you do best—running your business.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">For someone new to social media marketing, where should they start? Should they focus on creating content, learning about ads, or diving straight into automation?</strong></p><p id="""">The first step is to start creating content. Focus on sharing videos that showcase your expertise or tell your story. Don’t overthink it—just start.</p><p id="""">Once you’ve got a few posts, schedule a call with us. We’ll help you build a strategy and show you how Riff Social can amplify your reach.</p><p id="""">We also offer free weekly training sessions where you can learn the basics and get tips from our team.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s incredibly helpful. I know you mentioned a special offer for our listeners. Can you share more about that?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely! If you’ve already been posting, especially videos, we’ll run a free campaign for one of your posts. We’ll drive 5,000–10,000 views so you can see the power of Riff Social in action.</p><p id="""">Afterward, we can discuss how to incorporate this strategy into your overall marketing plan.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a generous offer, Jamie. Before we wrap up, do you have any final advice for our listeners?</strong></p><p id="""">Consistency is key. Whether it’s your health, your business, or building an audience, progress comes from showing up consistently and taking small steps every day.</p><p id="""">As Bill Hillestad likes to say, “Shut up and post. We’ll take care of the rest.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Jamie, thank you so much for joining us today. Your insights have been invaluable, and I know our listeners will get so much value from this episode. For everyone tuning in, don’t miss out on this opportunity to transform your business.

George Wright III here your host. I’ve got a good friend—someone that I’ve gotten to know really well and an amazing person—on the podcast today. So, I’m excited to have you here, Candace. How are you?</strong></p><p id="""">I’m good. Thanks for having me.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, listen, I want to give a little background on you, but for those tuning in, our goal is always to give you that daily dose of inspiration and education. More importantly, I want to share techniques, strategies, and tactics that you can use, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do today.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Candace’s Background and Real Estate Journey</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me give you a little bit of Candace’s background. Candace is an investor and realtor in the Twin Cities. She specializes in vacation and short-term rentals. She provides personalized, data-driven advice and employs strong negotiation skills to help her clients achieve their goals.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">As a single mother to a 13-year-old—and a dog, I would add—Candace embraces adventure. She’s an outdoors person, but she also has a ton of experience and resilience when it comes to business and real estate. I’m super glad to have you here today. Candace, would you mind sharing a little about your background so people can get an idea of where you’re from, what you’ve been doing, and what led you into this niche in real estate?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely. I was born and raised in Minnesota. I’ve always been into outdoor activities—hiking, biking, canoeing, and winter sports—so naturally, I love to travel and explore. That passion for travel led me to real estate.</p><p id="""">Right now, I help people in Minnesota buy and sell real estate, but real estate has also introduced me to the short-term rental and vacation market. Traveling myself, I’ve been able to experience luxury amenities and understand the nuances of being an investor. I’ve taken those insights and gotten creative with clients here in the Twin Cities area.</p><p id="""">Recently, I’ve expanded beyond Minnesota, helping people across the U.S. understand what it takes to succeed in the hospitality business. I think my adventurous spirit has naturally played a role in shaping my approach to real estate.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, so your passion for adventure led you into this niche. That’s awesome.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Balancing Business and Family Life</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now, as a single mom and entrepreneur, how have you been able to balance the demands of your business and family life while continuing to grow your investments? What’s your secret?</strong></p><p id="""">I would say scheduling everything—including non-negotiables—and treating them as appointments.</p><p id="""">For example, dinner with my son is an appointment. No one knows that it’s dinner; they just see that my calendar is blocked off. That time goes in first.</p><p id="""">Next, I color-coordinate my schedule so that I’m doing the most important tasks when I have the best energy—usually in the morning. That’s when I handle lead generation, follow-ups, and other high-value activities.</p><p id="""">You have to be disciplined. If something comes up, you have to decide: Am I saying yes to this? And if so, what am I saying no to? That mindset helps me stay focused on my goals.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. Over time, people talk about being busy versus productive. I think your calendar is a great indicator of both your success and drive. A lot of people think they need open blocks of time, but I like to fill my calendar first and then prioritize as things come up. I completely agree with your approach.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">For those listening, notice what she said—she fills in the important things first, then schedules everything else around them. That’s a great success principle.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Art of Networking and Connecting</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now, you’re known as a connector, right? There are a lot of people who network, but you take it to another level. Can you share how you’ve turned that skill into income? Because I know a lot of people who are great at networking and have strong relationships, but they struggle to monetize it. How have you been able to turn that into passive income and business growth?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely. I’ve always been focused on education, learning, and growing. I listen to a lot of podcasts, and if I find someone who stands out—someone doing something unique—I reach out and message them. That’s how I create partnerships with people I believe are doing extraordinary things.</p><p id="""">Sometimes, these people have completely different strengths than I do. Other times, they have a creative mindset that complements my own. Once that relationship is established, opportunities naturally arise—whether through real estate investments, referrals, or other collaborations.</p><p id="""">I also attract a lot of people who own Airbnbs. Many of the strategies I share can be applied anywhere, so when they start seeing success, they often want to buy more real estate. That’s when they need a realtor, and since I’ve already built trust, I’m usually the first person they turn to. In cases where I can’t personally help them, I connect them with other professionals I trust.</p><p id="""">It’s really about continuously finding great partners—whether through podcasts, social media, or industry events—and fostering those relationships.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, and you do a phenomenal job at that. I want to highlight something you said because I always tell our listeners that success leaves clues. You mentioned a key word—‘attract.’ You attract opportunities through relationships, rather than just chasing them.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A lot of people understand that relationships are important, but the ability to attract opportunities through those relationships is what sets you apart. That’s something people need to pay attention to.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Real Estate and Investment Strategies</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s talk about real estate for a minute. What are some of the biggest misconceptions people have when they enter the short-term rental market? A lot of people see it as a shiny new opportunity, but what are the common mistakes you see investors make?</strong></p><p id="""">One of the biggest misconceptions is around zoning and regulations. Many people don’t fully understand what they can and can’t do in a particular market—or how to pivot if new regulations are introduced.</p><p id="""">For example, in the Twin Cities, specifically Minneapolis, most HOAs don’t allow short-term rentals under 30 days. However, mid-term rentals can be a great alternative, but that’s a completely different strategy.</p><p id="""">Another example is Duluth, Minnesota. It’s a well-known vacation market, but there are very few permits available, and there’s often a waitlist to get one. Even though it’s a high-revenue market, the restrictions make it difficult to enter.</p><p id="""">A lot of investors don’t research these nuances before jumping in, and that can lead to major challenges down the line.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I agree. Investors need to enter these markets with their eyes wide open, but at the same time, they shouldn’t let these challenges hold them back. You’re a big believer in data-driven decisions. Do you have any tools or strategies you use to identify the best opportunities in the short-term rental market?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, my biggest piece of advice is to use multiple data sources—never rely on just one.</p><p id="""">Most people know about AirDNA, and BiggerPockets has some great calculators, but I also subscribe to <strong id="""">InvestTR by Vrolio</strong>, which provides mid-term and short-term rental data. Another great tool is <strong id="""">PriceLabs</strong>, which helps analyze market trends before purchasing a property.</p><p id="""">The key thing to remember is that <strong id="""">data is objective, but the way it’s reported can be subjective</strong>. For example, Airbnb calendars can be blocked incorrectly, which can distort occupancy rates. That’s why you need to cross-check multiple sources to get a clear picture.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. Too many people make investment decisions based on emotions rather than data. Now, let me ask you this—if someone is looking to enter the vacation rental market, do you have a go-to strategy that can work anywhere?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Unique and Profitable Rental Strategies</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">If someone is looking to enter the vacation rental market, do you have a go-to strategy that can work anywhere?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, I would say the key is to be unique and create an experience.</p><p id="""">That could mean investing in a uniquely shaped property, like a tiny home or an A-frame, or adding amenities that stand out. A lot of properties have common features like hot tubs and saunas, but you can go beyond that by offering something unexpected.</p><p id="""">For example, if your property is in a snowy area, you could provide snowshoes. If it’s near a lake, consider offering fishing poles, paddleboards, kayaks, or canoes. If you’re in a metro area, something like e-bikes can add value. The goal is to figure out why people are coming to that location and enhance their experience in a way that makes your property unforgettable.</p><p id="""">Another idea is to create a “hidden” feature—maybe a secret door that leads to a home theater or a themed space. Anything that keeps guests engaged and talking about your property will give you an edge over the competition.</p><p id="""">When you do something unique, you’re no longer competing in the general short-term rental market. Instead, you’re creating your own lane.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, that’s just like branding. We talk about this all the time on the show—standing out is everything. I love that recommendation.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now, you’ve also mentioned before that mid-term rentals can be more profitable with fewer expenses. When should investors consider a mid-term rental instead of a short-term rental?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">When to Choose a Mid-Term Rental Over a Short-Term Rental</strong></h3><p id="""">I think it comes down to risk tolerance. Mid-term rentals tend to be lower risk compared to short-term rentals.</p><p id="""">If you’re comfortable with a strategy that requires less day-to-day management but still earns more than a long-term lease, mid-term rentals are a great option.</p><p id="""">A lot of people know about traveling nurses, but if you do some research, you’ll find that certain hospitals pay more, which can drive a surge of healthcare workers to that area. Those locations can be great for mid-term rentals.</p><p id="""">Other factors to consider include:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Public transportation and accessibility</strong> – Is it easy for guests to get around?</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Demand drivers</strong> – Why are people coming to the area? Is it for work, medical reasons, or business travel?</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Pricing and profitability</strong> – Use tools like PriceLabs to determine if mid-term rentals can be a strong alternative in your market.</li></ul><p id="""">The key is to understand the <strong id="""">why</strong> behind your guests’ stay. Once you do that, you can position your property to meet their needs.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I like that a lot. Now, let’s shift gears and talk about market trends. What are some emerging trends in vacation rentals that investors should keep on their radar?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Emerging Trends in Vacation Rentals</strong></h3><p id="""">I think <strong id="""">uniqueness</strong> is a huge trend right now. There’s been a rise in boutique hotels and highly themed, experience-driven properties.</p><p id="""">Another trend is <strong id="""">maximalist design</strong>.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What is that? I haven’t heard of it.</strong></p><p id="""">It’s where everything is bold and over-the-top—huge murals, bright colors, extravagant patterns. For example, there’s a property here in Northeast Minneapolis called <strong id="""">The Dollhouse</strong>. It has leopard print spiral staircases, zebra stairs, neon lights—just really eclectic and vintage.</p><p id="""">I’ve seen similar properties in California and other major markets. People are looking for something different, something that makes their stay memorable.</p><p id="""">Another trend is <strong id="""">unique Airbnb experiences</strong>—like transforming a cave into a rental near a waterfall. People are craving experiences, not just places to stay.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, it’s not just about being unique; it’s about offering an experience. That makes sense.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Leveraging Digital Marketing to Increase Bookings</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That ties perfectly into influencer marketing and social media. Have you used digital marketing strategies to increase bookings and revenue?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. One of the best things you can do is <strong id="""">engage with social media communities</strong>—whether that’s Facebook groups, Instagram, or other platforms.</p><p id="""">Instead of just promoting my properties, I focus on <strong id="""">providing value</strong>—sharing insights, answering questions, and connecting with like-minded people. That kind of engagement naturally leads to opportunities.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, and you probably see this as much as I do—people are often afraid to put themselves out there. But the tipping point comes when they realize the power of being authentic.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">As a marketer, I’ve seen it time and time again. The polished, studio-shot content rarely performs as well as an iPhone video where you’re just being yourself. Have you noticed that too?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, absolutely. And even if you’re not comfortable on camera, you can still create content. You could just use your voice while showing footage of the property, or do walkthroughs without being in the frame.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Exactly. Start where you’re comfortable, and you’ll grow from there. Now, you’re on podcasts, featured in magazines, on TV, and even working with local government figures. But I’m sure it didn’t start that way.</strong></p><p id="""">Oh no, not at all. In the beginning, I wouldn’t do anything because I was too focused on making everything perfect—the backdrop, the sound, the lighting. It was rocky at first.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Resilience and Growth Mindset</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s so relatable. A lot of people let perfectionism hold them back. But I want to shift gears a little because I know you’ve faced personal challenges that have shaped your resilience and problem-solving skills. You’re a domestic violence survivor, and that experience has influenced the way you approach life and business. Can you share a bit about that?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely. I’ve had my share of adversity, and I’ve learned that you can look at challenges in two ways: You can see yourself as a victim, or you can ask, “Why is this happening for me?”</p><p id="""">Now, looking back, I realize those experiences happened <strong id="""">for</strong> me—not <strong id="""">to</strong> me. They shaped me, and they led to something truly meaningful.</p><p id="""">One of the biggest things to come out of my journey is <strong id="""">Linus’s Pet Haven</strong>—a pet-friendly domestic violence shelter I helped create. Many victims stay in unsafe situations because they don’t want to leave their pets behind. I wanted to change that.</p><p id="""">Originally, I envisioned a separate shelter just for pets, but it actually turned out even better. Now, survivors can bring their pets with them and keep them in their rooms, providing emotional support and healing.</p><p id="""">Seeing people actually use this resource has been life-changing. It took two years to bring this vision to life, but now that it’s here, I understand <strong id="""">why</strong> I went through those experiences.</p><p id="""">And of course, the shelter is named after my dog, Linus. It will always be a legacy of something I started to help others.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow, that’s powerful. I want to highlight something here for our listeners—this is the perfect example of turning pain into purpose.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You took something difficult, found meaning in it, and turned it into something that helps others. But that requires a certain mindset. You had to make the choice to see your experience as something that happened <em id="""">for</em> you, not <em id="""">to</em> you. That’s a game-changing perspective.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And what I love about your story is that it connects everything—your passion for pets, your real estate career, your personal journey. It’s all part of the bigger picture. Would you agree?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely. When your life and work align with your purpose, that’s when you feel truly successful. It’s not just about making money—it’s about making an impact.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Joy of Helping Others Succeed</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, what’s the most rewarding part of your work right now? What brings you the most joy?</strong></p><p id="""">Honestly, it’s seeing people take my advice, apply it, and get results.</p><p id="""">Whether I’m working with a realtor, an investor, or someone launching their first Airbnb, when they come back and say, “Hey, I did what you suggested, and it worked!”—that’s the best feeling.</p><p id="""">No one else can share that excitement like we can in that moment. It’s something special.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it’s the realization of both their dream and yours. That’s powerful.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Future Projects and What’s Next</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s next for you? Any exciting projects on the horizon?</strong></p><p id="""">Right now, I’m looking for a short-term rental in <strong id="""">Northeast Minneapolis, South Minneapolis, or a specific area in St. Paul</strong>.</p><p id="""">The goal is to make it a unique, experiential property that I can also use for <strong id="""">case studies and live training sessions</strong>. That way, people who want to learn about short-term rentals can <strong id="""">see the process in action</strong>.</p><p id="""">Another big goal is to <strong id="""">own 10 short-term rentals this year</strong>, so I’m actively searching in certain markets.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. You should document that journey—not just as a case study but as a behind-the-scenes process. People would get a ton of value from seeing how you do it step by step.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s a great idea! I think a lot of people would benefit from that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And what I love about your approach is that you don’t just try to create credibility—you actually live what you teach. You enjoy it, you share it, and that naturally builds trust.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Advice for New Real Estate Investors</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s say someone is just starting their real estate investing journey. What’s one key piece of advice you’d give them?</strong></p><p id="""">That’s a big question! But if I had to narrow it down, I’d say:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Learn from credible sources.</strong> Not everyone giving advice knows what they’re talking about. Find someone who’s actually done it—someone who is succeeding at a high level.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Connect with local experts.</strong> Real estate is heavily influenced by local trends, regulations, and market conditions. A knowledgeable local mentor can help you avoid costly mistakes.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Do your market research.</strong> Before jumping into a new market, ask: <br><ul id=""""><li id="""">What’s the <strong id="""">political climate</strong>? Are short-term rentals supported or restricted?</li><li id="""">What’s the <strong id="""">infrastructure like</strong>? Are there reliable cleaners, property managers, and maintenance workers? If not, managing the property remotely could be a challenge.</li></ul></li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, I love that. And we’ve talked before about the power of mentorship. Surrounding yourself with the right people can save you years of trial and error.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">If someone wants to connect with you, what’s the best way to reach out?</strong></p><p id="""">I normally don’t do this, but for this podcast, I’ll share my <strong id="""">personal calendar link</strong>. If anyone wants to schedule a <strong id="""">30-minute discovery call</strong>, they can use the link in the show notes.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s awesome! I’ll also list your social media handles and website so people can connect with you. And for our listeners—Candace is incredibly open and willing to help. I highly recommend reaching out.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We’ll also check back in on your case study and update our listeners as you build out your next rental project.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Guys, if you got value from this episode, do me a favor—share the show!

George Wright III here.&nbsp;We are joined today by an expert in Sales Strategies, Simon Severino. Welcome to the show, Simon.</strong></p><p id="""">Hey, George. Thanks for having me. Hello, everyone.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I don't do a lot of interviews, but I try to find individuals that I know will really bring some phenomenal value for the business owners and CEOs and high achievers that are in our show here. So I'm going to give a little bit of background.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Simon's the CEO of Strategy Sprints. He's done $2 billion in sales for his clients over the last 21 years. But he has an amazing list of templates that people can use in business in order to grow and expand their business. He's an individual that has a top-ranked podcast. He's the author of <em id="""">Strategy Sprints,</em> which I love the word and the term in general, TEDx speaker, Forbes contributor, and triathlete.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You're just an all-around very successful guy.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Simon's Journey into Sales</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So do me a favor, give everybody an idea of what took you into sales. Like, why is that the area that's your genius? What brought you into that originally?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, it's funny because it was never a goal of mine. When I started working, I was a strategy advisor in a big firm.</p><p id="""">And when you're a strategy advisor, you have to land your own clients. So I was always landing my own clients. And I didn't even know that it was for sales. I was just having clients, I was having work, and I had to solve big problems of how to enter the market, stay in the market, and keep market position.</p><p id="""">So I was so passionate about doing that, that the next project came in, the next project came in, the next project came. When I went on my own and became an entrepreneur, I realized so many moving parts, but actually, it's marketing, sales, and operations.</p><p id="""">And inside of sales, I realized that it's mostly psychology.</p><p id="""">It's really understanding the other side, asking really good questions, becoming a masterful listener and interviewer. And that's my passion. I love becoming better at buyer psychology and understanding why people buy what they buy, what's the best buying experience, and designing businesses accordingly, according to that buying experience.</p><p id="""">And so I'm really passionate because there is so much to learn about why buyers buy and how buyers buy. And second, there is not so much about it. There is a lot about selling, but there is not so much about buying. And yeah, I did fall in love with the buying question, and I'm still obsessed with that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. Obviously, like most people that eventually find the area that they're amazing at, they do it in life. They just go through business. And I love the way you put that phrase of the buyer psychology because I do think a lot of people don't understand how significant the sales process is.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Even if you're not the one selling and you're running a business, you've got to understand the significance of that. And the perspective that it's not just about having techniques and strategies to close deals. It's about having an understanding of the psychology of the buyer, of the other person. And a lot of people don't put effort into that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So I like that you say that, and I know you also have a lot of amazing strategies.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Effective Sales Strategies</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">But where does someone start to understand the psychology of the buyer? Where do you recommend people start to begin to understand what the mindset is of their ideal client?</strong></p><p id="""">I'll give you a practical example. We get six, seven, eight sales recordings from our clients so that we can give them feedback and increase the win rate.</p><p id="""">Now, what do you think makes the biggest difference in a high win rate in the 70% vs a very low win rate in the 10%? - it's the talking time. Talking time below 30% has a 70% win rate. So if you're talking 28% of the time, you are winning the deal 70% of the time.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what are you doing when you're not talking? You're listening?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, it turns out the biggest impact is being a good listener, but listening is not enough. You have to ask the right question and then listen.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that because we always hear in sales, ""Don't talk so much."" And so many people with sales presentations are just trying to sell, close, and they don't stop to listen.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But I never thought of tracking the metric of being aware of how much you are talking. So I like that a lot. But at what point, how do you become effective at asking the right questions? How do you become effective at really becoming strategic with your talk time?</strong></p><p id="""">So with all our clients, we help them develop their own sales script, which means 48 stages of closing the deal.</p><p id="""">There are eight very specific stages for closing big deals. In each stage, they have three powerful questions that are relevant to their buyers and that they feel good asking because they show their expertise. So for example, if they say, ""Yeah, but it's not the right time."" Now you might have different ways of answering that, but if you ask the right question right now, they will see, ""Oh my God, he's really intimately into my world.""</p><p id="""">He knows exactly where I am and why it's not the right time. And you ask the question in a way that has them thinking deeper around that, and you give them enough time. Now, you have established a stronger relationship. They feel that you're an expert, that you have intimacy with their world, and the space is a valuable space.</p><p id="""">And you don't have anything else. You don't have the product during the conversation. So you have only the conversation itself. So this is where you have to land value to move forward.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I actually really like how you put that—being strategic with your questions as well. You want to ask questions that are relevant to the buyer but also that showcase your expertise that allow you to lead the buyer.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How do you shorten the path? Because I think a lot of people in sales try to think of how to shorten the path to get a deal. How do you shorten the path? What is the way to do that?</strong></p><p id="""">We have to be backward-engineers. If you think about someone working with you for six months, what is the transformation? What changes in their life, in their business? Now we go back to the first week of working with you. How can we have them experience a small sample of that in the first seven days? In the first four hours?</p><p id="""">And now we go into the sales conversation—the first 40 minutes. Because you only have that conversation; otherwise, they will not move forward. So you have to have a sample of that. And the best way to sample that is not through presentations; it's by asking the right questions. You will have some samples of your right questions.</p><p id="""">For example, if your product is a CRM, you will ask how they follow up with leads right now. And then you'll ask, ""What do you do if you forget to follow up?""</p><p id="""">And they'll say, ""Oh my God, how do you know that I frequently forget to follow up?""</p><p id="""">By doing that, you're creating a moment that will happen three months later when they use the CRM and don't forget to follow up. But they will experience a sample of that right now. They’ll see the broken flow, the right flow, and they will experience the difference.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. I love it. One of the things in sales that I think people don’t understand—and your book is packed with this—is that people are really looking for roadmaps and paths to succeed. Asking better questions, understanding the psychology of your client, and ultimately, people just want to accelerate their sales.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Accelerating Business Growth</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">The whole idea behind your book—I wanted you to maybe take a minute and dig in a little bit to the “12 Ways to Accelerate Growth.” That’s what people want. They want to accelerate growth. And you have so many different things. I’m going to highly recommend that people listening to this check out the book because it’s packed with strategies and tactics. But what are some accelerated growth strategies that fit most businesses right now?</strong></p><p id="""">In the book, we outline the three levers for doubling revenue in 90 days. This is the Strategy Sprints method:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Increase the price by 25% for the same offer without losing clients. You do that by improving positioning.</li><li id="""">Improve the win rate by 25%. You achieve this by creating the eight-step playbook and reducing your talk time to 28%. Then, you practice by recording, reviewing your tape, and improving like an athlete.</li><li id="""">Reduce sales time by 25%, which increases your sales velocity by 25%.</li></ol><p id="""">Reducing sales time is tricky. You can tackle it in two ways. First, you shorten the time from awareness to closing by using videos and voice messages in a high-frequency cadence during the first 12 days. We call it the ""Relationship Building Sequence."" By doing this, you create 12 times the value in the first seven days and shorten the sales cycle by at least 25%.</p><p id="""">If that doesn’t work—because you’re dealing with a complex B2B scenario involving multiple stakeholders across departments and countries—we go to the other side of the funnel. Here, the focus shifts to retention, upselling, and cross-selling. Customers come for a solution, but they stay for a community.</p><p id="""">When you increase these three metrics by 25%, you effectively increase revenue by 99%.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. I love the simplicity of that. There are so many levers in sales, but those three—pricing, win rate, and sales cycle time—are primary. Do you find that clients struggle the most with the first one, increasing their pricing?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Most people undercharge, and they introduce pricing at the wrong point in the sales conversation. Pricing should only come in step six, but many people mention it in steps one, two, or three.</p><p id="""">The second mistake is they over-explain. For example:</p><p id="""">""Hey Simon, what’s the price of a sprint?""</p><p id="""">""It's $27,000, but you also get XYZ...""</p><p id="""">Instead, the correct approach is:</p><p id="""">""Hey Simon, what’s the price of a sprint?""</p><p id="""">""$27,000.""</p><p id="""">Then pause for 16 seconds—Obama-style silence.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s the purpose of that silence?</strong></p><p id="""">It shows you own it. You believe in its worth and its impact. If you try to justify the price, you’re telling the prospect you don’t believe in it yourself.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Practical Sales Tips and Tools</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve packed your book with strategies.

I am excited to be talking with you.</strong></p><p>George Wright III, I feel honored.</p><h3>Unlocking Your Genius Zone: Definition And Discovery</h3><p><strong>I appreciate that. Listen, I have been around a lot of big names over the years, grown global brands, but you have this unique gift. It is why I think a lot of people bring you into their practices, their businesses, and things to help them because you not only relate, you have got this relatability, but you get results. I want you to just start right out of the shoot with some real big value. I just want you to share with our audience this idea you have that you use called the Genius Zone. Can you define for our listeners what that means and how somebody discovers their Genius Zone?</strong></p><p>Genius zones are nothing new. Let us be real, I did not coin it, but I did realize along the way, when we are in flow, things just work. What is being in flow? Being in flow is not doing something that you are really not good at. You can get good at something. I was not good at business, but I knew I could become good, and I got into a flow with it. I was not a good business person at all. I was a starving artist type of person, and I did not care about money. I do not believe that people should say, ""I am not good at that.""</p><p>No, you are not good at that yet. You are not good at that because you never tried to be good at it. You are not good at that because it was not something important to you. I am not saying, ""Just do what is so easy for you,"" because that is giving up. A lot of what I am doing, I was not good at. I knew that I could learn it. Once I learned it, I got into a groove. I thought, ""Actually, some of this is my genius zone."" What I realized is that before I was a business person, I had a gift, and that is helping people make money. I had an identity.</p><p><strong>That is a great gift to have. People love it.</strong></p><p>I think so. People around me literally say, ""I made more money this month just because I know you.""</p><p><strong>I am curious why, because that is not just a strategy, which you have amazing strategy tactics. Why do you think they felt that? Why do you think they feel that? How important is that?</strong></p><p>It is proximity to people. We were talking about this with a colleague. He said, ""Jeanne, most people are not like you."" I said, ""Really, what do you mean?"" He said, ""Like you are, they are not upbeat. They are not on people's sides. They are not cheering for people. They are pessimists."" He is like this as well. He said, ""Me too, because we are like two peas in a pod. We are an anomaly. Pessimistic, just everything."" He said, ""Positivity is infectious."" I thought, “That is true. It is not like I was always like this. I was pretty negative in some ways when I was an actress, and it was like it was not working.” I am not saying I was born this way.</p><h3>The Mindset Shift: Overcoming Anxiety And Negative Beliefs</h3><p><strong>No, and you have been through a lot, like your journey, and not just going from 2,000 a month to 30 to 50 to 100 to scale into multi-millions, but you have also had a lot of shifts in your mindset, your habits, your decisions. Talk about a little bit of that. Talk through your journey of what you went through.</strong></p><p>It is important that you do not just say, ""Jeanne, you were like that."" No, I was not. I was negative. I was down and out. I was like, ""Oh my gosh."" I was scared to death, full of anxiety. I struggle with anxiety. Being me is not easy. I have to work on that every single day. I am winning, but it is not like I wake up and I am just like, ""I have an anxiety thing."" I do not have a disorder, but I struggle, and it is a challenge. I am finding that fight every day. I know what to do now.</p><p><strong>Many people fight that. Many people are dealing with that.</strong></p><p>It is when you realize, one day, I woke up, and I thought, ""You mean everybody does not live like this?"" I literally did not know that. I went through my whole life until about five years ago, and it dawned on me. ""You mean people do not wake up the way I do every day? I thought that was just human life."" It is crazy. It took me that long to figure it out. I just thought that was the way people were. I thought, ""Wait, I have a thing going on here."" It was so strange. It took me so long. I just thought that was the human condition to wake up with anxiety every day, literally.</p><p><strong>What brought you to the point where you realized that was the case? What was the pivot?</strong></p><p>I was observing a family member, and I thought, ""Wait, this family member has an issue with anxiety. So do I."" We both have a thing, and I said to this family member, and he went, ""Yeah, I know."" He said it took you long enough to figure it out because you are just going along your life, thinking that everybody thinks this way.</p><blockquote>Success never happens overnight.</blockquote><p>The point is, I think it is very important because I am not here to make people feel bad about themselves, because you know how bad that feels when you listen to successful people, and they have it all together, and you are like, ""Yeah, they're them. I'm me. They don't understand me."" I do understand you because it was not rosy. I worked very hard to neutralize emotions, understand a lot about mindset, and understand that people have such great value, and it is just sometimes their personality.</p><p>If you do not have a great personality, you can work on that. You do not have charisma. You can work on that. You can work on all of this. There are exercises because I was an actress to actually develop charisma. This thing, this cop out of, ""You were born like that."" Yes, some people are born like that. I was born with a sunny personality. I was, but then life happened, and I was not so sunny.</p><p><strong>Let us be clear to our audience. You were not originally this high-powered business strategist. You were a fashion designer, an actor, and a recruiter. You had all of these other types of things. You pivoted into this, and I guess it was like at 54, you decided you made a decision to go all in. What did that?</strong></p><p>At 54, I had already been coaching for eight years, by the way. Let us be real. People go, ""My goodness, she got online."" Not true. Overnight success is never an overnight success. I had been coaching for eight years, doing a lot of things. I was a good coach, and I could get to a certain level, but it was not sustainable, and about networking and more networking and being out there in the world.</p><p>I have kids, and I am a single mom, a solo parent. I just thought, ""I need to fix this because I had then been through another life crisis and all my money was vacuumed out of my life and I was again in deep debt."" I thought, ""This is not working offline. I need to get online."" That was the moment that changed it all. I got online, and I figured out how to do business more sustainably.</p><h3>The Pivotal Shift: From Fashion Blogger To Coaching Powerhouse</h3><p><strong>I want to ask you something because you have just made a point that I have some clarity for now. You did two transitional pivots. You went from this career you had into coaching, and I am curious what took you into that besides the fact that you realized that was one of your genius zones. There was this pivot that you had where you leveled up your coaching business, because I know there are a lot of coaches and consultants that are doing this, and they love it. They want to create impact, but they are not making any money. What got you into that industry initially?</strong></p><p>Let us be really transparent here. I had no choice. The first time I found myself with two kids, one year old and one four-year-old, in New York City, with no job and really no income at all. I had the bright idea to start a kids fashion blog, and guess what? Everybody in the world knew about the kids' fashion blog in three months. They loved it. I was great at spreading the word. It got me writing content every single day.</p><p>I showed it, and every day there was a blog post. I was a fashion designer, so I would attract the brands, and they would send me a bunch of free loot. My kids were the best-dressed poor kids in New York City. They had Gotti dresses, all sorts of stuff being sent to us, and I thought, ""This is great, but we cannot eat this."" We got a lot of loot, and I got a little bit of advertising, and it got me out there, and I was invited to nice parties.</p><p>I was a mini celebrity in the kids' blogging world. People were like, ""I love your blog."" It felt great. It felt amazing to have recognition at that point. I thought, ""It is not really making a lot of money and a little bit of advertising, but that is okay."" It got me out there, got me some confidence in writing, and people knew that was good. I really need to create a business that is going to make money. What do I do?</p><p>I wrote down everything possible where I could still stay at home, take care of my kids, and not farm them out because I will not do that. I thought the only thing I could do was coaching. Literally the only thing I can do. I cannot sell houses because I am not going to be out there showing houses. It is not sustainable. I cannot get a job. I thought the only thing that I can do that I am good at, because I used to coach actors and I am good at coaching. I thought this was a fit.</p><p>This is what I am going to do. I got certified at night online in my pajamas when my kids were sleeping to be a life coach. I started getting clients, and it was just word of mouth. That is the first way, but you cannot just keep doing that. I thought, and immediately I started helping people make money because, as I said, I have a gift, and then my coach said, ""You are actually a business coach.""</p><p>She said, ""All of your clients have businesses, and you are helping them make money, and you are figuring out how to market, even though you are a non-marketer, but somehow you know how to do that."" I said, “Okay.” It was all about business coaching, and life is always in there anyway. I started speaking gigs and being out there, but it was all about being out there. That is exhausting when you are taking care of two young kids, and I was homeschooling, and I was taking them to all their events. It was a lot. I hardly ever slept. I started getting clients, and I was just grateful that it was working at all. That was great.</p><p><strong>At that point, you had to have been acting as a future version of yourself because it did not sound like you had a lot of confidence in things initially, at least, but as you did more, you gained more traction, momentum, success, and more results. Interestingly, you say that because I know a lot of people, they know what they want to do, but they struggle with doing it because they have imposter syndrome. They do not feel like they know what they are doing. It is interesting to me how you, from the fashion industry, leaned into blogging, something you knew, and leaned into the next thing, which was coaching, because you had to. You have just built from there. It is so much mindset too.</strong></p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/695b76740f6e113b4d3f6d88_Graphics%20-%20Host%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Jeanne%20Omlor.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Authority Formula Podcast | Jeanne Omlor | Business Catalyst"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Do you want to hear the secret?</p><p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p>This is the secret. I realized that I had no time to fail. I realized that if I let myself wallow and be that, because I am very sensitive, and it was really hard because there is so much rejection and everything. I had already been through all the rejection of being an actress, so I was already primed. I realized at one point, whenever I doubt, I am losing time, I am not putting food on the table, and I cannot do that.</p><p><strong>I love how you said that there was no time to fail, but you accepted failure as just a stepping stone, so it did not stop you. It was not creating doubt. You were pushing through it anyway. That is so huge.</strong></p><p>What I mean by fail is, of course, I am failing, and I did not get everything. What I meant was I remember these days, and it just felt icky because I was not there yet. I was out there, and I had confidence because people respond very well to me. I had already been a top executive recruiter on Wall Street. I had confidence that I could deal with people. I already had that. I was not doubting that because I had evidence of that.</p><p>However, I had been through a lot of bad stuff, and I just thought, ""I am just going to go out and tell people what I do."" I was confident when I met people. When I had some sort of setback, usually I would wallow and self-doubt. We talk ourselves off the ledge. I thought, ""Now let us just look at this logically because I am big on logic."" When I have to talk myself off a ledge, what is happening here? Let me think. There is a time I have to doubt myself, feel bad about myself.</p><p>I put myself through the wringer, and I said to myself, ""How long do I usually take to do that?"" Good question. Let me see. It could be a week. I do not have a week or two weeks. That is wasting time. What I have to do is I have to learn how to process this in a minute. You know what I did? I figured out a system where I would pretend I would remember the old VHS like forward. I would fast-forward my self-doubt in a few seconds. I would do this. I would go, boom, done. That is how long it took.</p><h3>Be A Catalyst: The Secret To Fast-Forwarding Self-Doubt</h3><p><strong>I love that because you are not saying I avoided it. You are saying I pushed through it faster. That is awesome. What I love about that secret and that track to fast forwarding, and you said a couple of things, I think success leaves clues. At the end of the day, you are an emotional person. A lot of people are emotional people, but you turned it into a logical path that allowed you to push through it faster because you have to push through it faster.</strong></p><p><strong>None of us has time, really. I love how you said that because I think sometimes we do not realize the time we are spending is the problem in pushing forward. I was going to mention to you, you like to refer to yourself as a catalyst. That is a great example of that. I was going to ask you what you mean when you say you go into a business as a catalyst. How do you go into a business or someone who hires you as a catalyst for them and their company?</strong></p><p>Being a catalyst is helping other people have realizations that are just compounding everything. It is not about me saying, ""Go do that."" It is about, ""Did you think of that?"" “Actually, no, we did not.” That creates this other flow of ideas. ""Did you look into that?"" “No. How do you think?” It is not always a question. It is like, ""We did not even look at that. We did not even notice that."" Great. I think that static way of looking at things.</p><blockquote>Things are not as complex as people like to make them.</blockquote><p>There’s that info, and that’s what you get. Working with people, it is a synergy of creating a compound effect, and a catalyst is that. A catalyst is throwing something somewhere, and it just creates all this stuff happening. I do see myself as a catalyst and a conduit, but a conduit is different from a catalyst. A conduit is just a line.</p><p>A catalyst creates explosions. If you look at what a catalyst means, it can be like a fuse for an explosion. I look at myself as the fuse that explodes things in a good way. I am not God, and it is not all coming from me. I am just a person, and it is about the inspiration of getting people to think and figure it out.</p><p>They are bringing their value in because people that I am coaching know more about what they are doing than I do, because they are the experts. I am just helping them fix stuff around that. I am not helping them be. They could be a better leader, but if I am working with a company and he is the CEO of a tech company, I do not know as much as he does about his tech.</p><p>I am just looking for gaps, like what is going on and why is this not working? Personal life stuff sometimes as well. For the coaches and consultants, clearly, like I have a client who is one of the world's top innovation consultants. He knows way more about me than I do. I am helping him build his business.</p><h3>Purpose Beyond Profit: Maximizing Your Legacy And Impact</h3><p><strong>One of the reasons I really liked that catalyst comment is from two perspectives. One perspective is from a coach or a consultant, or anything in life. A lot of times, people feel like they have to have all the answers when the true benefit is being a catalyst for answers that people have inside them. The other perspective is that most businesses, what they really need more than an expert and a consultant is a catalyst. They need someone to come in and shake it up in a real positive way.</strong></p><p><strong>I wanted to ask you this question because I know we’re limited on time. You work with high-net-worth individuals, CEOs, and founders, but it is to help them maximize their impact, their purpose, and their legacy. That is a piece that, even if you are not to that level, you want to feel like you have an impact. I am wondering how you advise or help individuals to balance profitability in your business with impact and purpose.</strong></p><p>The first thing is that it is really important. Things are not as complex as people like to make them. I think somebody told me, ""You are a genius at getting stuff that would be complex and confusing and making it so simple that anybody can understand it, because I am not that smart, and I cannot activate unless it is something I can understand, and just, what do I do?""</p><p>People tell me all this stuff, and I say, ""Great. What is the first step?"" Silence. If you cannot figure out a first step, you cannot just do stuff. I always say, ""What do I do first? What is the first thing I can do?"" They cannot tell me. I said, ""I need to know how I start. I cannot just vaguely do a bunch of stuff all at once, but people are not good at breaking things down.""</p><p>I am good at breaking things down. The first thing we need to figure out is what we deeply desire. What do we really want? Not what we think we want because it makes us feel good. Let us say you say, ""I really want to just go buy another sports car, Jeanne."" Maybe that is true. You want to buy the sports car, but what do you really want? Maybe you are just a sports car fan. That is possible because you love cars.</p><p>It might be that what you really want is you want people to look at you a certain way. You want people to think, ""That is an important guy. He must have a lot of money."" “Why?” “It’s because of blah, blah.” When you really look at why we do stuff, the question of what you want is usually it is not the first answer.</p><p><strong>Sometimes you do not know right off the bat either. Somebody has to help pull it out of you.</strong></p><p>That is what I do with that. That is a long conversation. With those high-end people, I fly anywhere in the world, and I spend days with them because it is not going to be in one conference and not every single day, all day, but we will spend a day, take some time off, and meet again. It’s cooking. There is a lot of realization that happens when you get very deep about what you really want. I thought, “You really want to make more money? Really?”</p><blockquote>If your money is your whole life and you lose it overnight, then that means you have no life.</blockquote><p>At a certain point, people make a lot of money, and they do not really need to make more. It is just sports. That is when you are going up Maslow's hierarchy, when you get to a point where all your needs are taken care of. You can do whatever you want. You can travel wherever you want. You can go to any restaurant.</p><p>You can buy any clothes. That is where the emptiness really starts to set in. What do we do now? That is when people start getting into bad behaviors because they need more of a thrill. Does that make sense? People who always need a new thrill are empty inside. Just thrill upon thrill, that is when you have to really think about ""What is my purpose here? How do I actually create impact?"" I do not really like that word, but there is no other word for it but make a difference. A bad difference or a big difference. A lot of bad people made a big difference.</p><p>I also hate that. ""I just want to make a difference."" I always say to myself, ""A bad or good one?"" It is a lot of platitudes and cliches, but that aside, we need to figure out ""How do I want to be?"" not ""What do I want to do?"" How do I want to be as a human being? What do I do? How do I want to feel about myself? I am going to feel like I woke up, and it is just that I made money and made people miserable, and I did not help people. Most people want to feel like they have helped other people if they are normal human beings.</p><p><strong>Those emotions are what we are really looking for. We are just trying to get the profits and everything else to be able to help us get those. You do not need to have those to get them. I love what you are saying, because I think at a high level, that is a challenge I think a lot of founders, CEOs, and ultra-high net worth individuals struggle with. I think if you, even at a lower level, begin to ask yourself those questions, why and what is it you are really trying to create? What do you want your life to be like? Those will navigate you down a path that might be slightly different than what you are going down, but do it and be able to do both. That is a big key.</strong></p><p>The fact is, if we lose our money, which we can overnight, and that is your whole life, that means you have no life. Money can be lost. You really want to make sure that you are developing all this other stuff. ""I lost the money, but that is okay because I am a good person. I am a good parent, and I have friends, and I help people."" Not good, and it is upsetting, but you are not committing suicide like a lot of people did when they lost their money because that was their whole life. People with purpose do not commit suicide when they lose their money.</p><h3>Final Advice: Stop Making Excuses And Start Today</h3><p><strong>I also want to leave a couple of key messages around what you just said, because I think not only do you need to determine what it is and why you want to do it, but I think it is never too late to start creating the life that you want to live, or it is never too late to start aligning your impact and your purpose with your fulfillment and your business. I really like that. I wish we had a ton of time.</strong></p><p><strong>I am going to ask you to come back and speak to our academy. Before I do, I want to just ask you two final questions. What would be your advice in the current market for people who are trying to level up? Is there anything in particular that just comes to mind for you for any way that you would like to leave our audience with? How can they get a hold of you? How can they get in touch with you?</strong></p><p>Let us talk about the coaches and consultants, because that is actually my bread and butter. Do not wait. Stop listening to the news. Stop listening to everybody. Stop making excuses. Stop using the excuses as an excuse that ""The economy and this president or that president,"" because I hear that every single time there is any president, quite frankly.</p><p>Just do it because every moment that you are waiting, you are wasting precious time, and you are never going to get that back. As I said, you can lose your money and can make it back again, a hundred millionfold. You cannot get time back. Stop the excuses, whether they are conscious or really get clear on whether the excuses are because everybody has a million excuses for why they do not do stuff. I never used excuses ever.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/695b76851e4d55548e5506a1_Graphics%20-%20Guest%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Jeanne%20Omlor.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Authority Formula Podcast | Jeanne Omlor | Business Catalyst"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>I did not even know what was going on with politics most of the time because I had my head down.

That is a gift when you are blind to what is going on sometimes, because you just function. Figure out what you want? If you want to make money helping other people as a coach or consultant, a business person, or whatever, just do it. I think somebody else said that.</p><p><strong>Yes, for sure. No, I love it. It is great advice. It is one that everyone needs to stop listening to and do. Just literally stop hearing it and actually take action on it. What is the best place for them to get a hold of you?

George Wright III here. &nbsp;I’ve got a treat for you today. We're really excited about the guest we have, Mike Bennett, who’s joining us on the podcast. How are you doing, Mike?</strong></p><p id="""">I'm doing really well and happy to be here.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, this is really good. I know we've been talking a bunch over the last little while, and I know you're heading on a trip out to Japan. But before we really get going, I want to do a quick introduction for those of you that are joining us.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">First of all, if you haven’t yet, make sure you like and subscribe to the podcast. You don’t want to miss any of these amazing interviews we're doing—especially as we’re launching the </strong><a href=""https://www.authoritymedianetwork.com/"" id=""""><strong id="""">Authority Formula Podcast</strong></a><strong id=""""> in our joint venture with </strong><a href=""https://valiantceo.com/"" id=""""><strong id="""">Valiant CEO Magazine</strong></a><strong id="""">, where Mike will also be a featured guest.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But let me give you his background real quick.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Mike Bennett's Background and Journey</strong></h3><p id="""">So, Mike Bennett—besides being a speaker, consultant, and dentist—is an expert and specialist in the area we’re going to talk about: sleep dentistry. He’s a DDS, PhD, board-certified dentist, and educator. And he’s passionate about more than just teeth.</p><p id="""">It’s about helping people to breathe, sleep, and heal through airway-focused care. With a PhD in healthcare profession education, he really empowers dentists, clients, and the general public to understand the critical link between oral health and whole-body wellness, which is really unique.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I really love that extra full-body focus, because everyone knows here at the podcast, I’m all about mind, body, money, business, and lifestyle. But you have a mission to transform the lives of both dentists and individuals—is that right?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, that’s so true. Yes, I do.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want you to do me a favor and just give everyone that’s listening your backstory. Help us understand—because being a dentist is one thing—but moving into sleep dentistry, that’s been a journey for you. So give us a little bit of your background and what bridged you over into this whole specialty.</strong></p><p id="""">Okay, yeah, that’s a great question. I’ve pondered a lot about that, and I think it has a lot to do with my early days.</p><p id="""">As a teenage 19-year-old, I served on a church service mission in New Zealand for a couple of years. While I was there, I noticed a lot of people had oral issues. We spoke to thousands of people over that period of time, and I don’t know—my eye was drawn a little bit to the mouth.</p><p id="""">Before that experience, I had shadowed a dentist and got my feet wet a little bit. I should say, my hands wet.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Your hands wet—not really dental humor. It’s better when you’re under the influence of nitrous. It’s a lot better. Hey, we should be doing this podcast with a little…</strong></p><p id="""">No, that’s a good idea.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Okay, next time.</strong></p><p id="""">Next time.</p><p id="""">But anyway, I came away from that experience feeling like I could improve the health of the world, at least in my little locality, by helping people with their oral health. So I came back and really got into the dental track and jumped right into that.</p><p id="""">But along the way, I had these feelings of, “I want the whole body—I want to understand the whole body. I want to understand how it heals itself.” I was really torn between dental school and medical school. Even all the way through dental school—until my third year—I wasn’t completely sold on being a dentist.</p><p id="""">And it was finally one day in my junior year—and I had two kids—and I thought, “I just need to graduate. I need to be a dentist and support my family.” But my heart was still thinking, “Can I go to medical school and do all those things?”</p><p id="""">Long story short, I went into dentistry, didn’t realize what I didn’t know, and found out that as dentists, we are the experts in the oral area.</p><p id="""">The oral cavity—the mouth—happens to be positioned right under the brain, under the nasal structures, and the throat/airway structures. Anything I do in the mouth can influence the way a person breathes. And what’s more important to the human body than air—than oxygen, right?</p><p id="""">You only live three minutes without it, and if you don’t, you get brain damage and keep living. That’s not a good thing.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Sleep Dentistry</strong></h3><p id="""">And so I realized, if I could somehow enhance the function of the human upper airway, then the body itself could be its own physician. It could work on itself, repair itself, heal itself. Because while we sleep, our bodies are healing—or at least they should be. And the body is amazingly resilient.</p><p id="""">If we get poor sleep, we can do that year after year, decade after decade, and still somehow manage and not have a lot of chronic problems. But the reality is—it does catch up to us eventually. Poor sleep.</p><p id="""">And so I was excited to realize that at some point.</p><p id="""">One of the things that jumped out at me early on also was when I would do dental work in a person’s mouth, and they would come back five or six years later and say, “My crown’s broken.”</p><p id="""">“That crown you put in—it’s broken.”</p><p id="""">Now, how’d that happen? Did I not do a good enough job? Was my lab not good enough?</p><p id="""">And of course, those were exactly the questions I was asking myself. Then I realized—wait a minute—if I’m doing a good job, which I felt I was, and my labs were top-notch as well, what’s going on in the body to create forces strong enough to break a really hard substance like zirconia or porcelain?</p><p id="""">It turns out that if a person doesn’t breathe properly, they tend to exert heavy forces. They’ve measured them—up to 300 pounds per square inch—in the mouth. So it’s like a human man my size...</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">...standing on a one-inch section of your mouth and expecting that crown not to break.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So wait—first of all, by the way, I had never thought about the idea that dental work was more than just “I gotta get my teeth maintained.” That’s a huge point. And I know you had a dental practice for a long period of time. It sounds like this was one of those pivot points, like a lot of people have, where they realize there’s actually more going on.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So I also didn’t realize it affected your dental work as well. So you were seeing people having issues coming back. Is that kind of when things transitioned—or... Help us understand. Because I know you had a practice, went into a specialty, and kind of came back. Is this what shifted you into the area of sleep dentistry?</strong></p><p id="""">It is.</p><p id="""">Over those first 12 years of practice, I noticed all of these oral signs: worn-down teeth, broken teeth, lots of gum recession, periodontal disease, bone loss, sensitive teeth to hot/cold/sweets... all of those things—teeth in general just breaking down—were linked to chronic, poor sleep.</p><p id="""">And the literature confirmed that—again and again. And I thought, wait a minute. If I just treat symptoms my whole career—one tooth at a time—how am I going to really help these people heal permanently and avoid problems in the future?</p><p id="""">So that led from one thing to another—traveling the country and even outside the country looking for experts who knew what they were talking about. I met some wonderful people over the years.</p><p id="""">Eventually, I came back and realized—it’s really hard to implement sleep treatment, screening, and management in a general practice. I didn’t really have a mentor to help me. I had some mentors, but I found that it was mostly on my shoulders. It was tough on the staff. So I thought—I’d better specialize.</p><p id="""">So after 12 years, I specialized—then spent 10 years (so my 22nd year in practice) just doing full-time sleep disorders, chronic pain, headaches, jaw disorders, popping/clicking, TMJ-type things—and having an airway focus through all of that.</p><p id="""">That’s how it morphed.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow, that’s interesting. And I want to point this out because in a featured article you did for Valiant CEO Magazine, you made this comment that dentistry isn’t just about teeth—it’s about total health.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Which I think is something everyone listening needs to realize—that sometimes the problems you have are the result of deeper causes, not just surface-level issues. It’s about more than just teeth when it comes to health. But also, this specific area of sleep.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I want to point out something else—because I always try to do this when we have guests: I know we’re going to have both professionals and patients/families listening. There’s a principle here that I think you’ve really embodied. You were already very successful in your practice. You didn’t have to go out and learn more or specialize—but you did.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s what separates people. Whether it’s dentists or any other profession—you have people who just do their job, and others who go above and beyond. You zeroed in on this after seeing what was happening. But you were an early pioneer in this area, right? Was it weird for you—being one of the few doing it? Because sleep dentistry wasn’t even a “thing” yet.</strong></p><p id="""">I was early on, yes—but it had actually been around for a number of years. In the 1960s, they were already talking about it. It just didn’t reach the mainstream until—I’d say—the 1990s.</p><p id="""">I graduated in ’99, and in the early 2000s, it really started to gain interest from dentists. But it’s really been in the last 10 years that this wave of interest has grown significantly.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So when you were learning early on, you were seeking out information and studying. Was it difficult for you to have conversations with your patients or even other dentists? Because if you had said that to me back then, I’d probably be like, “Huh?” Was it hard to talk about something you knew could make a real difference?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, you just pointed out one of my weaknesses right there.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s that?</strong></p><p id="""">When I learn something and I’m excited about it, I just feel like I want to share it with the world. But not everybody is ready to listen—nor are they interested.</p><p id="""">Some people are just like, “Just fix my teeth.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah—just, you’re a dentist. Worry about my teeth and gums. That’s all I want from you.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly—and that’s totally fine.</p><p id="""">There are times when I come back from a seminar, or I’ve been reading a book, and I’m excited about telling someone, “Hey, the signs I’m seeing in your mouth—those are risk factors for sleep. There’s a possible sleep disorder. Are you interested in being further screened to see if there’s a problem?”</p><p id="""">There’s a significant stigma about sleep apnea out there—that only overweight people have it—and that is just not the case. That is a myth. One hundred percent.</p><p id="""">So sometimes when I bring it up, it’s like I just called them a name or something.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, they take it personally.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s like, “What? Look at me. I’m not overweight—I don’t have sleep apnea. I sleep great.”</p><p id="""">But... your teeth are worn down. You have gum disease. You get cavities every time you come in. You’re flossing, brushing... but they still come.</p><p id="""">So yeah, there’s definitely pushback—from all stakeholders out there. Patients. Parents of patients. Even the team. And other dentists, too. It’s like, “Just stay in your lane. Don’t look outside of it.”</p><p id="""">There is some pressure. But...</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Real-Life Success Stories</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’ve just seen too many examples of success stories where people’s lives were changed. Can you give us a few examples—whether patients, dentists, or even health-related? What are some examples that really stuck with you?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah—children especially are poignant, but adults as well. One child I worked with was a 9-year-old boy from out of state. He’d actually fly into Utah with his mom to get work done.</p><p id="""">He wet the bed every night. He was being bullied at school. He smelled like urine all the time, and he couldn’t stop. He’s nine, for heaven’s sake. Nine years old and still bedwetting.</p><p id="""">He was a recluse. Didn’t want to go out. Didn’t hang out with friends or socialize. He didn’t have a lot of energy.</p><p id="""">His mom had heard about what I was doing to help grow the mouth—so there would be more room for the tongue and the airway in children. She sought me out.</p><p id="""">We worked on him. We put him in a device, and in the first 30 days—just helping him breathe through his nose and open up his airway—he stopped bedwetting.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Really? Stopped bedwetting? And it was all because of his airway?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, overall it was.</p><p id="""">It’s the compensations the body goes through when the airway is pinched or compromised. For example, if you hold your breath, your heart starts pounding. Your blood pressure goes up. Your brain says, “Hey, get rid of this pressure,” so it tells your kidneys to dump it.</p><p id="""">And if you’re a child, and you’re in bed, you’re going to pee out that pressure.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s crazy. It’s amazing she even noticed that. But I think—as you said—as more and more education and information become available online, people are starting to realize what I mentioned earlier: the results we see are not always caused by what we think.</strong></p><p id="""">Yep, absolutely.</p><p id="""">And you don’t realize that when your body is in a state of fight-or-flight—survival mode—it reallocates energy to different parts of the body. It wants you to survive the night, even if you’re not breathing well.</p><p id="""">So it’ll do things like empty your bladder. Or take energy away from your digestive system—so you’re not digesting your food well. You get more gas, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea.</p><p id="""">And your mouth becomes dry from mouth breathing—so you get gum disease and cavities, because bacteria sticks to dry surfaces and causes problems.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Just like with most health issues—people are treating the symptoms, not the actual problem.</strong></p><p id="""">Yep.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Do you have another example? I know you mentioned adults as well. I would’ve never guessed bedwetting was that significant—but clearly, it changed his life.</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, absolutely. It did.</p><p id="""">I called his mother a few months after we had finished treatment—about 15 months total—and she said, “It’s just amazing what my boy is doing.”</p><p id="""">He’s out hanging with friends at the mall. He’s only on one medication now—he used to be on three: two for asthma and one for allergies. Now it’s just a bronchodilator as needed.</p><p id="""">He’s a new person. A student leader in school. His mom is so excited. She always knew this boy was there—but he couldn’t sleep, because he couldn’t breathe. And he was having tissue issues and all kinds of problems.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Treatment Options and Innovations</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">And before we wrap up, I want to dig into some of the treatments you do—but first, do you have any other examples?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah—a couple.</p><p id="""">A woman from Arizona came up and told me she had been fired from two jobs because of her chronic migraines. Just low energy. She’d wake up in the morning and say, “I can’t go to work,” and call in sick again.</p><p id="""">Her employer worked with her for a while, but eventually said, “We’ve got to have someone we can count on.”</p><p id="""">She heard I was doing migraine treatments and jaw treatments. She came to Utah, and we helped her. Turns out, she had undiagnosed sleep apnea.</p><p id="""">We created a plan to help her establish better breathing so her sleep could improve. We also did some things to help her jaw and facial muscles.</p><p id="""">Long story short: we reduced her migraines to where she only had one every few months. It didn’t go away completely—she had some other underlying issues—but it was significantly better.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I’m sure in many cases it’s a team effort, right? You’re working with other doctors or specialists.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah—absolutely. Other doctors. Chiropractors. Physical therapists. ENT specialists. Allergy doctors. Physicians. The list goes on. Even GI doctors.</p><p id="""">It’s interesting—almost every medical specialty has some kind of connection. If your sleep is poor, the effects ripple through the entire body.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. And that’s something I think a lot of our listeners—entrepreneurs, professionals, business owners—are dealing with. Migraines. Stress. Chronic overload.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And they don’t realize the ripple effect it’s having on their health.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Common Symptoms and Self-Diagnosis</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What are some of the more common symptoms people should look out for—especially if they’re not thinking “sleep disorder”? Are there signs people should be watching for?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, definitely.</p><p id="""">Beyond the mouth signs—like worn teeth, gum recession, and dry mouth—there are physical signs like bags under the eyes.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me pause and highlight this for our listeners: receding gums, bad teeth... those can actually be symptoms of sleep issues?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes.</p><p id="""">And the tongue is a window to your airway. If you stick out your tongue in the mirror and see imprints from your teeth along the sides, it means your tongue doesn’t have enough room in the mouth.</p><p id="""">So where does it go when your teeth are closed? Right back into your airway.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oh—so your tongue is literally blocking your airway.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s a big muscle that can plop right back into the airway. The signs—like scalloped edges or indentations from the teeth—show that the tongue is being compressed.</p><p id="""">You’ll also sometimes see a big fissure down the center of the tongue because it’s folding over on itself to fit in the mouth.</p><p id="""">There are other signs too: daytime sleepiness, not dreaming at night, waking up unrefreshed, dragging yourself out of bed after 8 hours of sleep. An average adult should get 7–8 hours. The younger you are, the more sleep you need. Infants need 18 hours a day.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And sometimes it feels like the opposite—the older I get, the more I need to sleep. But I get what you’re saying. It varies.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. There are also medical history clues—like reflux, heartburn, hypertension, cancer, and Alzheimer’s in the family. Snoring is a big one too.</p><p id="""">If you’re snoring, you’re breathing—but if it’s loud, it’s challenged breathing. That’s highly correlated with sleep apnea.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now I know you’ve mentioned before that you personally had some sleep challenges. Was that something you discovered while learning about all of this—or was it what led you to it?</strong></p><p id="""">It actually caused me to look inward and realize—wait a minute—all those years I was tired while studying, I felt like I couldn’t remember things as well.</p><p id="""">I did fine in school, but I always felt like, “I could do better than this.”</p><p id="""">I didn’t realize at the time that I had sleep apnea. I wasn’t diagnosed until my 40s, after attending a course where they did sleep testing. Sure enough—it showed up.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Could you comment on that? Because even for me, when you say sleep apnea, I think: CPAP machines, can’t breathe, scary stuff. What exactly is sleep apnea?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, good question.</p><p id="""">From the tip of your nose down to your vocal cords, it’s about a 10-inch section. It can be pinched at any point along the way.</p><p id="""">If it’s pinched while you’re sleeping for more than 10 seconds, and if your oxygen drops at least 3% each time—that’s considered one sleep apnea event.</p><p id="""">If you have five of those in an hour, that’s considered sleep apnea.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So it’s not an all-or-nothing thing. It’s a condition that can vary. That explains why so many people go undiagnosed.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly.</p><p id="""">And when you’re just tired, you don’t necessarily think, “I have a sleep disorder.” You just assume, “This is my normal.”</p><p id="""">But is your normal really normal?</p><p id="""">Often, it isn’t. Not until you realize: “Other people don’t need three naps a day. They don’t need energy drinks. They don’t wake up groggy after 8 hours.”</p><p id="""">I never got into energy drinks, but I used to take naps all through my 30s and 40s, just trying to function.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So as you looked back, did you realize these issues started even earlier in your life?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes. As a child, I had teeth pulled because my mouth was so crowded—for braces.</p><p id="""">That was the traditional way to treat crowding: remove teeth.</p><p id="""">As it turns out, that didn’t really fix the problem. My teeth straightened, sure—but I still had a crowded mouth. Even now, I’ve gone through lots of remodeling, expansion, orthodontic work to reestablish my airway.</p><p id="""">The genetic code for human beings codes for 32 teeth. If you don’t have 32 teeth, your jaws are likely underdeveloped genetically.</p><p id="""">I had my wisdom teeth out—plus additional ones.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, same here. Funny story—my dentist told me I actually had extra teeth, like little baby ones tucked back there.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s interesting because, as an entrepreneur—and I know a lot of business owners listening can relate—we think it's normal to be tired. We're hustling, working long hours, building something for our families. It’s like we expect to be tired, right?</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s almost worn like a badge of honor: “I’m tired because I’m grinding.”</p><p id="""">But what people don’t realize is how much more productive and optimized they could be if they were actually sleeping well.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Right. Health and energy are force multipliers. If you get them right, everything else works better.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely—100%.</p><p id="""">Sleep time is designed to recharge you for the next 16 hours. As an entrepreneur, you need that fuel to go slay the dragon every day.</p><p id="""">But you’re trying to do it on four cylinders, when your engine was designed for eight.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a great analogy. And it’s crazy that people accept that as normal.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I’m sure—one of the things I want to make sure we do with this episode—is include links in the show notes to your website and newsletter. Because I think our goal here is to create awareness.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You've already helped listeners recognize potential symptoms and think about diagnoses. But let’s talk treatment for a minute—because people hear “sleep apnea” and think it automatically means oral surgery or a CPAP machine. What are some of the typical treatment options—home remedies, professional treatments, or what you’d recommend depending on the situation?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, you bet.</p><p id="""">One of the earliest conditions we often treat is snoring. Usually, it’s the wife coming in saying, “Hey, can you fix my husband? I can’t sleep in the same bed anymore.”</p><p id="""">So we start with nasal support.</p><p id="""">There are products out there—like Mute nasal dilators—that are inserted into the nostrils. There are magnetic nasal strips you place across the nostrils to help open up airflow. They’re kind of like those Breathe Right strips athletes wear.</p><p id="""">Studies show if you open up your nasal valves, you actually perform better as an athlete. Same idea here.</p><p id="""">So you can start with things like that.</p><p id="""">Another is nasal hygiene. Use a clear nasal spray to moisturize and clean the nose. We talk about mouth hygiene, foot hygiene, hand hygiene—but we never talk about nose hygiene.</p><p id="""">Keeping your nose clean is a great way to help with breathing.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. I never even thought about that—nasal hygiene as a thing. Makes total sense. What about once it moves into more clinical territory?</strong></p><p id="""">If someone has apnea, we can use an oral device—something that gently holds the tongue and jaw forward to open the airway.</p><p id="""">When used alongside some simple exercises to tone the tongue muscle, that tongue will start to stay put during sleep.</p><p id="""">If you’ve got nasal support and the tongue stays out of the airway, you’re breathing more freely—and oftentimes, that’s enough.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s interesting because people tend to think of this as just another treatment routine, but what they don’t realize is the multiplier effect—how significantly energy, focus, and performance improve when you breathe and sleep properly.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s why I really wanted to have you on—because these are the kinds of things that go overlooked but make a massive difference.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, and let me just add: Stephen Covey talks about sharpening the saw.</p><p id="""">If you get your sleep right, you become your best self. You’re equipped to accomplish your mission—whatever that is.</p><p id="""">I had a woman with chronic migraines who wanted to go on a service trip with her husband but couldn’t. Once we got her breathing corrected, she was able to go to Germany and serve. It was awesome to see that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s powerful. But I’m guessing CPAP is still the most common go-to for sleep apnea, right?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes. CPAP is still the traditional treatment.</p><p id="""">But it’s a mask worn over a very sensitive part of your body—your face—and strapped to your head. It’s very difficult for many people to tolerate.</p><p id="""">In fact, about 70% of people stop using CPAP after a year. Medicare stats show most only use it four hours a night, if at all.</p><p id="""">Even oral appliances aren’t perfect—there’s about a 30% drop-off rate after a year.</p><p id="""">So if you work with a doctor like me—who evaluates the whole airway and collaborates with a team of specialists—we can usually open the airway using non-surgical or surgical options. And often, you can avoid using CPAP or even a long-term oral device.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. So it really becomes about customizing the treatment and looking at the whole picture.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly.</p><p id="""">A guy came in just the other day—we fit him with an oral device and did a laser procedure on his palate. He told me, “I’ve dropped 15 pounds in the last three weeks.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. That’s incredible.</strong></p><p id="""">He didn’t change anything else. Just started breathing better—and his metabolism kicked in. His body began working like it was designed to.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. Because I think most people just assume they’re tired and need more sleep. So they try to rest more or manage their stress—but they’re not fixing the real problem.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m curious—because clearly, you’re doing things very differently than most dentists—where do you think the future of this is going? Beyond awareness, is the technology advancing? Are there better tools or methods coming that make this all easier?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes—technology is improving. This is a great time to be both a patient and a dentist treating airway issues.</p><p id="""">For example, let’s say you came in and were diagnosed with sleep apnea. If you didn’t want a CPAP machine, I’d suggest an oral appliance—but traditionally, you’d have to wait four weeks to get one made.</p><p id="""">Meanwhile, you’re still not breathing or sleeping well.</p><p id="""">Now, we’re beta testing technology where dentists can 3D print devices right in the office. Same day.</p><p id="""">So you could come in, get diagnosed, and walk out with a fully customized oral appliance that night—ready to start sleeping better immediately.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s amazing. So the same-day tech we’ve seen with crowns and restorations is now moving into sleep devices too?</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly.</p><p id="""">We’ve been doing same-day crowns for years. Now, the industry is moving toward same-day snoring and apnea devices as well.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a huge leap forward. And I know you’re not just treating patients—you’re also educating dentists, speaking at events, and consulting. Are you mostly training providers now? Or working with families too?</strong></p><p id="""">Mostly my colleagues right now—dentists who want to implement screening and treatment strategies into their practice.</p><p id="""">But yes, I do speak to families and the general public as well. In fact, I’m heading to Asia soon—to Taiwan and Japan—to meet with orthodontists, dentists, and industry leaders to talk about this.</p><p id="""">But we’ve also created materials specifically for parents and families—simplified guides to help them know what to look for and where to go for help.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. Because this mission you’re on—it’s not just about helping dentists grow professionally. It’s about giving families better health, better energy, better quality of life.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s the best way for people to connect with you? Whether they’re a dentist, healthcare provider, or parent looking for answers?</strong></p><p id="""">Online is the best way. I have a website, LinkedIn, and other platforms.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Perfect. What I’ll do is add those links to the show notes—your website, newsletter, social media—so people can connect. And I want to say: your newsletter is excellent. It’s mostly for professionals, right?</strong></p><p id="""">It is—but we try to write it in a way that works for both healthcare providers and the general public. It’s a 3- to 5-minute read with clear, practical takeaways—bite-sized and easy to digest.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it’s really well done. So let me wrap with this: is there one last recommendation, idea, or strategy you’d give to the average person listening right now? Something they can do today to impact their health?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes—be your own advocate.</p><p id="""">Take ownership of your health. If you don’t, who will?</p><p id="""">And remember: the human body is its own physician. It can heal itself if you give it the rest and recovery it needs. Sleep is critical.</p><p id="""">Talk with your healthcare provider. Make sure you feel good about your care. If you don’t—keep asking questions, keep looking. Your intuition will tell you when something resonates. Follow that.</p><p id="""">Have the courage to pursue it. The knowledge is out there. We just have to seek it out and take action.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s brilliant advice. I always say on this podcast—it’s never too late to live the life you were meant to live. But you’ve got to take responsibility for it. And it’s never been easier to get informed and take action.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">From what you’re saying, it’s not even that hard anymore.

I’m your host, George Wright III here. Today, I’m joined by a special guest, Bronson Kaufusi. How are you doing, man?</strong></p><p id="""">I’m doing great! Thanks for having me.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m really glad we connected through some mutual friends. For those who don’t know, Bronson is an NFL player, mindset coach, and investor. He was an All-American high school athlete, went to BYU, and got drafted into the NFL in 2016. You’ve played for the Ravens, Jets, and Packers, and now you’re transitioning into a career in investing and business. We’ve got so much to unpack today, so thanks again for being here.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, I’m excited to share my story and some cool experiences.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Bronson’s Early Life and Football Journey</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s start with your background. People love that “American Dream” story—growing up, high school, and chasing your dream of making it to the NFL. Take us back to the beginning and tell us a little about your journey.</strong></p><p id="""">Sure! My dad moved here from Tonga when he was nine years old. He grew up playing rugby, but his high school football coaches saw him playing rugby with his brothers and told him he should try football. He started playing and kicked off the whole football world for my family.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So it became a family legacy?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, exactly. From him on, over 20 of my first cousins, uncles, and aunties have played college football. My dad set the tone. He played in college, made it to the NFL, and became a coach. I grew up around the game, inspired by his players and by being part of that environment.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Did you realize early on that football could become a career?</strong></p><p id="""">Not at first. It wasn’t until high school that it hit me—football could pay for college. That was all I thought about at the time. But then in college, I realized I could get drafted into the NFL. Every level opened my eyes to new possibilities.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">If your dad was a coach, did you grow up with a really disciplined structure? Was it like, “No shortcuts, earn everything?”</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. My dad was all about earning it. In fact, when I was being recruited as a tight end, he was a defensive line coach and didn’t offer me a scholarship. He wanted me to earn everything. When he became my coach in college, it was even tougher. I had to go harder every day—there was no favoritism.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">High School and College Football Experience</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It sounds like you thrived on that challenge.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, I loved the challenge of pushing myself every day. Whether it was football or anything else, I wanted to get the most out of every day. That mindset carried me through high school, college, and beyond.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A lot of successful people say their routines and discipline almost become automatic. Do you think that was true for you?</strong></p><p id="""">For sure. I was so conditioned to success principles and daily rituals that it felt natural. But people don’t always realize the structure and discipline behind it—it’s a lot of hard work that just looks effortless from the outside.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Draft Night and NFL Challenges</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You get drafted into the NFL by the Baltimore Ravens—such a huge milestone—but then you break your ankle during your rookie year. That had to be devastating.</strong></p><p id="""">Draft night is the high of highs. You get the call, “This is the Baltimore Ravens, we’re drafting you right now.” It’s surreal—your family is ecstatic, and you feel on top of the world. But fast forward 100 days, and I’m lying on the ground with a dislocated ankle and a spiral fracture in my leg.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How did that happen?</strong></p><p id="""">It was during a scrimmage. I was locked up on the end, and a linebacker went airborne, hitting my legs while I was planted. I heard everything go, and I knew immediately my season was over.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Mindset Training and Overcoming Injury</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">How did you start to recover mentally?</strong></p><p id="""">Fortunately, I’d been doing mindset training in college with my coach, Craig Manning. I had conditioned my subconscious to find the positive in every situation. I used to write down three things that went well each day, and that practice changed my outlook.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Do you think that preconditioning made the difference?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, 100%. If I hadn’t been training my mindset before I needed it, it would have been so much harder to recover. Instead, I focused on what I could do to get better.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What other practices helped you stay positive?</strong></p><p id="""">Journaling was huge for me. I’d write down what I wanted to work on and what I did well. It helped me shift from being overly critical to focusing on the positives.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Discovering New Opportunities</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You eventually transitioned into business and investing. How did that shift happen?</strong></p><p id="""">It started when I was with the Jets. I noticed my teammate, Brandon Copeland, always talking on his phone. I asked him, “What are you doing?” He told me he was running his businesses—flipping houses and more. It opened my eyes to the idea that I could do more too.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So that was a lightbulb moment?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, it made me realize that the ceiling I thought existed was invisible. <em id="""">There was so much more I could do beyond football.</em> That’s when I started exploring real estate investing.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Transitioning to Business and Real Estate</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Was it intimidating to dive into something new like real estate?</strong></p><p id="""">Definitely. I was nervous, especially with my first deal. But I leaned into my strengths—building relationships and asking questions. I surrounded myself with people who knew more than me and stayed humble.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It sounds like humility played a big role.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Successful people are usually willing to share their knowledge if you’re willing to ask. Being teachable opens so many doors.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Launching the Young Athlete Society</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now you’re launching the Young Athlete Society. What’s the vision behind it?</strong></p><p id="""">I want to help young athletes with mindset training and create an ecosystem that includes parents and coaches. Sports teach so many lessons—discipline, resilience, teamwork—that can be applied to life beyond the field.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why focus on young athletes?</strong></p><p id="""">Looking back, I wished I’d had more access to mentors when I was in high school. I want to be that resource for kids—to help them train their minds before they need it, just like I did.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">This has been such an inspiring conversation. Where can people follow you?</strong></p><p id="""">They can find me on Instagram and Twitter at<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/bkafusi90"" id=""""> @BKafusi90</a>.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We’ll link that in the show notes.

I hope people remember to never give up. <em id="""">When times get tough, that’s when you need to put fuel on the fire.</em> Stay present, and keep pushing forward.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Great advice.

I'm joined today by an amazing leadership host, topic CEO. I'm going to give them an introduction in a minute here, but Dr. Eric, how are you doing today?</strong></p><p id="""">I'm doing great, George. Thanks for having me on.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oh, man, it's a pleasure. We have some very similar backgrounds. I'm super excited. So listen, guys, buckle up. I want to give you a quick little background.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Dr. Eric Holsapple's Background and Achievements</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">We've got a very diverse guest, one that I really feel will bring some value to you today. He's a PhD in economics. He's got a real estate background and has been a CEO in real estate development for over 40 years. But he's also rounded it off, I feel, with this idea that he's practiced yoga and meditation for over 30 years. He's had the Entrepreneur of the Year Award a couple of times, and he's the author of the book <em id="""">Profit with Presence</em> and the founder of Living in the Gap. We're going to talk a little bit more about Living in the Gap, but his company focuses on teaching CEOs and professionals different ways to operate in mindfulness and still grow.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So with that introduction, I would love it if you'd give us just a little bit of your background and this bridge that came from entrepreneurship or business into mindfulness. Give us a little bit of the backstory.</strong></p><p id="""">I'd be happy to. I was raised in rural Maine and went to the University of Maine and then out to Colorado State University. I got an MBA and always worked, but I got my first job in real estate after that MBA. I was immediately successful in real estate. Within a couple of years, I was a general manager and then president shortly thereafter of a North American division of an Australian company.</p><p id="""">I started in Denver and then moved to Los Angeles, traveling between Denver, Princeton, New Jersey, Western Canada, and reporting to the UK and Australia. I had all the outward signs of success. I had the six-figure salary, the Mercedes, the apartment. I had all those things. But I was not happy. I was overweight. I was single.</p><p id="""">I remember my 30th birthday and a little bit after that, I got transferred to Boston to help with a company there. I couldn't button my top shirt button for my tie or my belt, and I wasn't giving in. I finally got an apartment there with a scale. I remember stepping on it and thinking, ""God, you better make some changes, or you're not going to be around very long."" I had one of those aha moments. So I made some changes. I left that job, lost a bunch of weight, started running again, and found yoga. That was my first entry into mindfulness.</p><p id="""">I had been an athlete growing up but hadn't done anything in four or five years. I got back into sports. My older brother, at the time estranged from the family, was a poet, and my dad was a football coach. They were like oil and water. For 10 years or so, he didn’t come around the family much. Then I watched my older brother take up meditation and come back to the family. He got closer to my dad. My dad didn’t change—he was in his seventies—but he opened up. I got my family back. My brother said, “Hey, you want to try it?” I said, “Sure, I’ll try it.”</p><p id="""">So I tried meditation and had immediate results. I felt less stress, more focus, and improved relationships. My sports improved, and I was just happier. But for a lot of years, I didn’t come out as a meditator. I just did it on my own for 10 to 15 years. Gradually, as I got through my PhD program, back into developing with my own company, teaching on the side, and raising a family, people started noticing changes in me.</p><p id="""">People started coming up to me saying, ""What are you doing? I have this problem. What do you do? What do you know?"" They noticed changes in me. I became someone easier to talk to than I had been historically because I run 150 miles an hour—I'm a hard-charging guy.</p><p id="""">Anyway, we started a seed group at our company where we would just read a book and talk about centering. We didn’t get weird or woo about meditation; we just talked about centering and read books. Before I knew it, the room was full. The management committee got together and changed the vision statement to 'mindfully creating community.' Everyone started getting involved in nonprofits, giving back, putting their families first, and making changes.</p><p id="""">It made a huge difference—the same difference I noticed in my life, I saw others experience. Later, I launched Living in the Gap, a nonprofit where we train others to do that.</p><p id="""">And what I’ve really found—I love capitalism—but for capitalism to work, people have to give back when they can.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You have to. That’s...yeah, I totally agree with that. It’s funny—I feel like our stories are very similar. I’m learning more and more that when I interact with people, they have similar stories as well: chasing success, getting that success, realizing it’s not the end-all, be-all, and it’s not making them happy.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’ve got a question for you. It’s one that maybe you have an answer to, or maybe you have multiple answers to. You mentioned an aha moment. Do you think it was several years or a period of time? What do you think it was that caused this need or shift? Was it an aha moment? Or was it that you accomplished success but found it unfulfilling? What do you think it is? Because I had a similar type of experience.</strong></p><p id="""">I think it was both for me. But generally, I call it in my book a cultural lie. We’ve been raised to believe that if we do all the right things—study hard, get into the right schools, get the degree, get the right job, meet the ideal spouse, get married, have the family, have the two houses and the cars, and get these ideal vacations—that someday we get to be happy.</p><p id="""">What I found for myself and many other successful people I’ve been friends with over the years is that we just keep moving the goalposts. We say, “Oh, it’s not this house, it’s that house. It’s the second car. Or I want to travel, so I’ll fly. I want to fly first class. No, I’d like to fly private. Now I want to take a trip to the moon.” We keep changing the goalposts.</p><p id="""">That’s that hot dog on a string—happiness. Harvard’s done a lot of work on this. It’s like what Copernicus said: The sun doesn’t revolve around the earth; the earth revolves around the sun. Similarly, success revolves around happiness. Happy people are more successful.</p><p id="""">We all know people who are monetarily successful but not happy. We also know people who have very little and are happy. But I think you can have it all. You can have those material things, but you have to realize that happiness doesn’t come from them. Happiness doesn’t come from just that pot of gold. You’ve got to have happiness to enjoy the pot of gold.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. I’m a big advocate of the fact that you can’t just achieve happiness; you’ve got to be happily achieving. And I think that’s exactly the shift to mindfulness, which is now taking the success you’ve had and bridging it into a mission, a purpose, a thing you’re doing with the book, your company, and Living in the Gap.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Mindfulness in Business</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Help me understand how you tie mindfulness into leadership and business. Sometimes people aren’t aware of the need for mindfulness until it’s past the point of wishing they had it. How do you bring mindfulness into leadership and business? How does mindfulness pertain to business, and how do you try to tie the two together for people?</strong></p><p id="""">Efficiency and focus. First of all, on a personal level, it’s stress reduction. It makes you more grateful, makes you happier, and improves your relationships. But to make the business case for it, you have to show it improves business outcomes. In my case, it has.</p><p id="""">I’m sure there are instances where people say, “I don’t want to do this anymore,” but most people feel like, “Oh, someday, when I get to be successful, I’ll start being mindful.” My belief is that if I’m focusing on a meeting, it means my phone and apps aren’t open. I’m actually talking to the person in the meeting.</p><p id="""">When I’m focused, I can move the world in a few hours a day. If I’m distracted and divided, I can spend 12 hours a day and get very little done. There are so many options for our attention that we have to decide to reclaim it and focus on what we choose.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I totally agree. And I think entrepreneurs and CEOs often believe that the hustle is what has gotten them to where they are. When you shift to mindfulness, they worry it might feel like taking their foot off the gas. How do you explain to people that being mindful actually enhances focus, efficiency, and productivity, rather than taking their edge away?</strong></p><p id="""">For most producers, you can’t stop producing even if you want to. People fear they’ll lose their edge. There’s a guy named George Mumford who worked with Phil Jackson during the Bulls and Lakers days. He coached Kobe Bryant and told Kobe, “Go out there tonight and try not to score.”</p><p id="""">Kobe ended up scoring 60 points by passing more and focusing on opportunities, rather than forcing things. For real producers, it’s in their DNA—it’s not something they’ll stop doing.</p><p id="""">But what’s the purpose of it if you don’t enjoy it or aren’t making the difference you can make? Profit isn’t a purpose; it’s the result of a purpose-driven life that meets a need. I love capitalism, but profit is a result, not the end-all, be-all.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love what you said. I want to make a note of this and really point out to our listeners the idea that if you've been working most of your life, developing habits for production, and you're a producer or a performer, you've likely developed those habits. You don’t necessarily need to focus on them anymore. In other words, you can take that natural ability, now that you've developed those habits of success, and focus on something with more purpose and presence. Trust yourself.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Trust yourself. If I had to make the choice to produce a little less to be happier, more satisfied, and have better relationships, I’d choose that. But in my experience, you actually get more done in less time and make a bigger difference.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">12 Pillars of Mindful Leadership</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, talk to me a little bit about the book. I love the title, <em id="""">Profit with Presence,</em> and this idea of the 12 Pillars of Leadership. Do you want to take a minute and walk us through some of those?</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. The idea is that I’ve been in the mindfulness community for a while. What I’ve noticed is that not all, but a lot of people in the mindfulness community, think money is dirty—it taints you. On the other hand, people in the business community think mindfulness is “woo.”</p><p id="""">I’ve been able to bridge that gap and show that mindfulness is about focus and presence. We live in a capitalist society, and it’s absurd to think that making money makes you dirty. I buck that notion. We’re householders, not renunciants living on a hill in India. I run a business, I have a family, and I have responsibilities. It’s okay for me to make money. But what do I do with it?</p><p id="""">I make my life better, my family’s life better, and the community better. <em id="""">Profit with Presence</em> is about doing both—making money and being mindful.</p><p id="""">The 12 Pillars of Mindful Leadership start with what I call the foundational pillars. The first three are:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Be present and practice mindfulness.</strong> Everything of consequence—whether it’s athletics, music, or business—takes practice, and so does mindfulness. Develop practices that allow you to be more present in your life.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Identify your purpose in life.</strong> Purpose isn’t about profit. One inner purpose is to be awake and present. Life is a blessing, and recognizing that is a purpose in itself.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Create clarity, vision, intention, commitment, and habits.</strong> Clarity comes from mindfulness and purpose. Studies show that visioning can be as effective as taking action. Intentions are powerful. Commitment and habits must align—if your habits don’t support your commitments, it’s hard to live up to them.</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love the foundational aspect because I think a lot of times people, especially as they get older or more established in their careers, feel like they’ve already set up foundational things. But as you said, sometimes their habits and commitments don’t line up. Until you consciously work through that process, you don’t see the disconnect.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. And that disconnect is often what keeps people from achieving their greatness.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Starting with Mindfulness</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me ask you a question: for professionals—CEOs or business owners—who are limited on time, where do you recommend they start with mindfulness? Is it a practice, a course? Where should someone start to incorporate mindfulness into their daily life?</strong></p><p id="""">The key is that it takes less to get started than most people think. Consistency matters more than the length of time. With meditation, I recommend starting with just two minutes. Build up from there until it becomes a habit.</p><p id="""">The mind is so busy when we first start that jumping into 20 or 30 minutes can be counterproductive. What’s important is to do whatever keeps you consistent.</p><p id="""">The lowest-hanging fruit is gratitude. The impact is immediate, and the science is irrefutable. Starting with gratitude—just having the intention to be more mindful—can create significant changes.</p><p id="""">Another simple practice is a mindful walk. Take 10 minutes at lunch, leave your phone behind, and just walk. If you’re scrolling on your phone during the walk, it’s not mindful. We can unplug for 10 minutes and reconnect with nature or simply observe our surroundings.</p><p id="""">Start small. Be consistent. Maybe pick up a little book on mindfulness. As you practice, you’ll become more efficient, and it will naturally expand into other areas of your life.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You made a great point that many of these topics are practices. Even gratitude is a practice—I do it every morning. Identifying moments of gratitude is a simple but powerful habit.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Living in the Gap</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">One of my last questions is about your company, Living in the Gap. I don’t want to make assumptions, but I’m guessing it relates to bridging profit and presence. What does the name mean to you?</strong></p><p id="""">There are many gaps, but the primary one is creating space between thoughts and recognizing who you truly are. In those gaps—those spaces between thoughts—is where peace, joy, and happiness reside. Stress and anxiety come from how we think about things, not the things themselves.</p><p id="""">Most of us have hobbies like painting, skiing, or fly fishing, where we create those gaps and are fully present. The goal is to bring that presence into other parts of life, like work.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I also think this is a big point: what’s your intention with the gaps? Most people’s intention is to fill them. If there’s a gap, they feel the need to fill it—scrolling through</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">email, TV, Netflix, or whatever. But if your intention is to create more gaps, that’s where fulfillment and happiness come from. So, here’s a question for the audience: what’s your intention with the gaps? Is it to create more gaps or to fill them? I would argue that peace, fulfillment, and happiness come from creating more gaps.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s such a great question. And you’re absolutely right. When our intention is to create space and embrace those gaps, we find more joy and balance. This has been a wonderful discussion.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion and Call to Action</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I completely agree. This has been a fantastic conversation. I think we might want to dive deeper into this with our academy members. But at the end of the day, where’s the best place for people to connect with you, learn more about what you do, and get more information on mindfulness and leadership?</strong></p><p id="""">Check out our website,<a href=""https://livinginthegap.org"" id=""""> livinginthegap.org</a>. We have free resources on how to get started with mindfulness and details on our programs. The book, <em id="""">Profit with Presence,</em> also outlines a process for awakening and becoming more purposeful—not just at home but also at work. We spend more time at work than anywhere else, so it’s important to bring mindfulness there as well.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s fantastic. I’ll include the link to your site and the book in our show notes. To everyone listening, definitely grab a copy of the book. If you’re a high performer, CEO, business owner, or investor, find those opportunities to create more gaps. It’ll not only bring more fulfillment but also improve focus, clarity, and productivity.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I believe it’s never too late to start practicing mindfulness, and it can go a long way for you. Dr. Eric, I really appreciate you being here. This has been an incredible discussion.</strong></p><p id="""">Thanks for having me, George. It’s been a pleasure.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">All right, everybody, don’t forget to share the show! Hit me up on The Daily Mastermind on Instagram or Facebook and let me know your thoughts.

Most of it, though, has been circled around fractional work—a lot of fractional IT companies, fractional CFO, fractional administration with fund administration, and SPV creation.</p><p id="""">So a lot of it has revolved around that entrepreneurial mindset of, “Okay, let’s figure out what is going to work best for you and your needs,” as opposed to the check-in, check-out kind of behavior. A lot of it is circled around that mentality of discovery and understanding.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fractional is a really big thing right now. But were you into a certain niche of business? Was it primarily IT, fractional IT work, or what other things? Because, look, you’re a sales, marketing, entrepreneur overall, but what area of fractions were you in heavily before you started to get out on your own?</strong></p><p id="""">Sales. So I was running sales and then jumped into the director of sales, strategic partnership roles, etc.</p><p id="""">But my whole M.O. with the fractional world was truly business strategy and understanding what’s going to work best. And that could have been within the CTO space, CIO space, into the CFO world. As I jumped in between different fractional teams to really understand the lay of the land.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. What’s interesting is a lot of business owners, when they have that kind of diverse background like yourself, I find that they’re a little bit more successful because they understand all the elements of everything. Especially if it’s sales versus individuals that come from just IT or engineering or something like that. It makes it harder to jump into that world. Was it then not very difficult for you to jump into the entrepreneurial market as a business owner of your own?</strong></p><p id="""">It definitely happened on the fluke side of things. However, way back when, I worked for my father, who owned a gun shop years back. He opened it in either ’59 or ’69—one of those dates.</p><p id="""">And what spurred this whole motion of thought was that you don’t have to do the typical behavior. You can look outside of the box. You can always discover a new way of saying hello in a different language, right?</p><p id="""">My mind was always shifting and rolling with just conversations with my old pops, right?</p><p id="""">Where things really took a dynamic turn was when I was at the fractional CTO firm. We ended up really crafting a new way of providing service, which then had me stepping back and thinking, <em id="""">maybe there's something here that I could innovate or change the game.</em></p><p id="""">We wanted to show that communication between IT departments and C-suite individuals could actually work and that IT was not just a cost center.</p><p id="""">That’s where the journey really began. I started a little startup and worked on that for a good chunk of time, which then stirred into various connections with investors, other founders, and the community. I just jumped into that world, not really knowing that it was a world to begin with. But that was really the catalyst that spurred it all on.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Concept of <em id="""">Sh</em>t Pitch*</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It's interesting because I want to get real heavily into this new out-of-the-box idea you have with your pitch event. I think you laid the groundwork for it. In other words, you've been an out-of-the-box thinker for a while. Was it an aha moment when you started Sht Pitch? And I’m sure people are doing a double take, thinking, “Is he saying that right?”*</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So let’s start with this—what is Sht Pitch? And then let’s back up and help me understand—did you have an aha moment with this, or did it slowly transition into it? How did you lead yourself into this world of what you’re currently doing? And then we’ll break it down.*</strong></p><p id="""">Okay, I'll give you the summary—the two-second version of <em id="""">Sh</em>t Pitch*. <em id="""">Sh</em>t Pitch* is about showing the human behind the startup—showing off more of the jockey than just the horse.</p><p id="""">A lot of investors in the community and abroad don’t just look at the business pitch deck, its valuation, or its requirements. They’re looking at <em id="""">who</em> is running it behind the scenes. And that’s really critical because those are the individuals that either make it or break it.</p><p id="""">To answer your second question—how did this start? I was working with a really cool group of angel investors and VCs here in Utah, and we were all thinking the same thing: <em id="""">We’ve got to change the pitch and the narrative of what pitch events for entrepreneurs and investors are all about.</em></p><p id="""">Are we actually doing everybody a service, or are we doing them a disservice with what we’re currently doing?</p><p id="""">Because nine times out of ten, every investor could look at a pitch deck, compare it to the over-rehearsed business pitch given by the founder, and say, “Great, I could have just read that on my own.”</p><p id="""">So I got a group together, and I said, “Let’s throw out this wild, crazy idea and experiment. Let’s just have some fun. Let’s be human for once and see what happens.”</p><p id="""">They brought some founders, I brought some founders, we tossed them on stage, and at first, it was different than what it is today. But the whole premise was: <em id="""">let’s make sure they have time for their real business, like a normal pitch event for entrepreneurs. But let’s also give them something that they’re not prepared for—something that lets us see more of who they really are as people.</em></p><p id="""">We give them a really bad idea, completely impromptu, and it’s a ridiculous idea that shouldn't exist. So nobody is investing in these, don’t worry.</p><p id="""">But what we’re doing is putting these founders in a position to show off—how do they communicate? How do they work through a problem? How do they adapt? Can we see a little bit of that behavior?</p><p id="""">Instead of just a lunch talking about their business, we see their energy, creativity, and how they handle challenges.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Human Element in Pitching</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. What’s so crazy is that I love that overview, and I had so many questions. I was going to jump in, but I wanted to get the full deal first because now we can go back and unpack it a little bit. I think it's brilliant, and I think you're right—it’s morphed over time. But it starts with this premise that I’ve had in all the companies I’ve built, in raising funds, and in working with investment funds. The idea that most true investors, in the end, will always look at the numbers. But they invest in the people more than the product.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You could have an amazing product and a horrible founder—or vice versa. So, I think it's a great point for listeners to understand that the person behind the business is just as important. That’s why with our authority marketing company, we emphasize that founders need to be visible. They need to be out there. So I love that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You were already working in this space. What made you transition from focusing just on the business pitch to saying, ""Let’s throw that out the window and do something different""? Was it a fluke idea? Was it something you felt was missing? What was the moment that made you decide to take this angle?</strong></p><p id="""">I think it came down to exactly what you just mentioned. Every big name behind you on your board has gone through a systematic approach to personal branding or personal awareness, right? But a lot of early founders don’t get that shot.</p><p id="""">So we thought, <em id="""">How do we help these founders really show off who they are as human beings?</em></p><p id="""">Through creative conversations and brainstorming with different investors, this idea surfaced as an experiment. I told everyone, “Let’s just try this out.” Even to the founders, I said, “Let’s play a little game. Worst-case scenario, all you’ve had is more time in front of investors.”</p><p id="""">And it worked.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Breaking the Facade: Humor, Adaptability, and Pressure</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s genius because not only do you get to see their skills—how they adapt, how they think on their feet—but you also get to see their personality. Their humor, their ability to communicate under pressure, all of it.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And especially today, with AI and everything looking so polished and perfect, I think people crave authenticity. This breaks the ice and forces them to be real. What made you decide to also bring in that improv-style humor? Because it almost feels like an impromptu comedy show, but with real business implications.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s the funny part—I’ve had extroverts get on stage and be very serious, and I’ve had introverts who were absolutely hilarious.</p><p id="""">I’m not funny, so I leave the comedy to everyone else. But for those that want a pressure cooker, <em id="""">Sh</em>t Pitch* definitely delivers.</p><p id="""">And here’s the thing—people are naturally more relaxed when they’re in a room watching something lighthearted versus something overly serious.</p><p id="""">So I thought, <em id="""">How do we bridge that gap?</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The bottom line is, you're doing that. And I thought this was brilliant—you have them do this before their real pitch. So investors get a feel for them before they go into their actual business presentation. Do you feel like they try to maintain character knowing their real pitch is coming up, or do you really see them open up? What do you do to put them at ease so they don’t hold back?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s tricky because everyone is so different.</p><p id="""">I tell them before they go on stage, “I’m not going to dictate how you should do this. What we want to see is <em id="""">you</em>. I’m going to give you a topic, and it’s up to you to decide how it should be presented.”</p><p id="""">That gives them the freedom to either show off their skills or, in some cases, try to mimic someone else—which usually backfires.</p><p id="""">Nine times out of ten, if they try to imitate someone else’s style, they flop. And we all see it.</p><p id="""">But <em id="""">Sh</em>t Pitch* is not a comedy roast. That’s important. We’re not roasting founders. We’re showcasing opportunities. We’re revealing how people communicate under pressure, how they handle unexpected situations.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Investors Reading Between the Lines</strong></h3><p id="""">We've had investors approach founders afterward and say, “Hey, you seem more like a COO than a CEO. Have you thought about different roles within your company?”</p><p id="""">It’s about understanding <em id="""">people</em>, not just the business structure.</p><p id="""">That’s the real insight—what makes an effective economy is understanding human behavior. And when we do that right, we actually help founders position themselves better for long-term success.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. And I wanted to dive deeper into one thing you mentioned earlier—where you said investors can see if someone is lying or stretching the truth during this process. What did you mean by that? And why did you choose to bring that specific aspect into the pitch format?</strong></p><p id="""">I'll give you an example.</p><p id="""">We had a founder on stage at one of our CNBC-filmed events. His impromptu topic was <em id="""">Silent Karaoke</em>. It was supposed to be a joke, right?</p><p id="""">But instead of going the comedic route, he said, “I’d like to take a different angle. I have a family member who is deaf, and I want to pitch this idea as a real solution.”</p><p id="""">And he did.</p><p id="""">His delivery had me tearing up. I looked around the audience—there were actual tears.</p><p id="""">Now, obviously, there were <em id="""">half-truths</em> in his pitch because it was a fake idea. But it showed how he communicates, how he builds emotion, how he works through a challenge.</p><p id="""">And that’s what investors need to see—how do you sell an idea when you don’t have all the answers?</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Insights on Successful Founders</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s crazy because, at the end of the day, what you’re really uncovering is their ability to adapt. That’s a crucial skill in business. You’re not just testing their pitch—you’re testing their thinking.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">With all the founders you’ve worked with, have you noticed any common characteristics among the ones who are really successful at raising money? Are they usually the natural-born entrepreneurs, or do you find that success comes from something else?</strong></p><p id="""">I'd say there are diamonds in the rough.</p><p id="""">Some first-time founders come in and absolutely dominate an investor conversation. They can pull investors through their story and get them engaged. But for most founders, success comes down to experience, iteration, and validation.</p><p id="""">And my philosophy is this: <strong id="""">Most early-stage founders should not be looking for direct investment.</strong></p><p id="""">Not because they don’t have a great idea, but because they often haven’t validated it enough.</p><p id="""">A lot of founders get caught up in the mindset of <em id="""">I need funding now</em>, but the reality is—do you have LOIs (Letters of Intent)? Do you have a customer base? Have you validated the business model?</p><p id="""">Too many entrepreneurs spend all their energy chasing investment before they’ve built a foundation, and that’s where they get stuck.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a great insight because I think most founders assume that the moment they have a great idea, they should immediately seek funding. But what you’re saying is, hold off—get some proof of traction first.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. The founders we put on stage are usually at the <strong id="""">seed</strong> and <strong id="""">Series A</strong> levels, because by that point, they’ve already started generating revenue.</p><p id="""">If a company isn’t generating revenue yet, the only exception we make is for life sciences or med-tech companies—because those take longer to reach profitability.</p><p id="""">But for other startups, revenue matters.</p><p id="""">That’s why, even though we let pre-seed founders participate in the event, they need to have momentum. They need to show progress.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what’s the number one trait that you’ve seen among founders who actually get investment?</strong></p><p id="""">Action.</p><p id="""">It’s always about <strong id="""">action-driven execution</strong>.</p><p id="""">I’ve seen founders who weren’t the best public speakers, who weren’t the most charismatic, but they got funding because they could <strong id="""">prove</strong> they were making things happen.</p><p id="""">They weren’t just talking about their vision—they had actual data, traction, and milestones to back it up.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Difference Between Selling a Product vs. Pitching an Investor</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s huge. Because I think most founders assume that if they can sell their product, they can sell their business to an investor—but that’s not always the case. What’s the biggest difference between selling your product and pitching to an investor?</strong></p><p id="""">It comes down to <strong id="""">three things:</strong></p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Storytelling</strong> – If there’s no compelling reason behind what you’re building, investors won’t connect with it.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Team</strong> – You need to know who is on your team, what gaps exist, and how you’re planning to fill them.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Capital Strategy</strong> – Investors want to know exactly how you plan to use their money. You don’t need to have every detail figured out, but you do need to demonstrate <strong id="""">intent</strong> and <strong id="""">purpose</strong> behind every dollar you’re raising.</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">That last point is so important because a lot of founders just say, ""We need $1M for growth,"" but they don’t have a clear plan for how they’ll allocate it.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Investors aren’t just looking at <em id="""">how much</em> you need—they want to know <em id="""">why</em> you need it, <em id="""">how</em> you’ll use it, and <em id="""">when</em> they’ll see a return.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Most Memorable Pitches</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve done a ton of these events. What are some of the craziest or most memorable pitches you’ve had on stage?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh man, we’ve had some wild ones.</p><p id="""">One of the funniest was <strong id="""">Pigeon Messaging</strong>.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pigeon Messaging?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah! The founder was given the prompt <em id="""">pigeon messaging</em>—just two words. He could interpret it however he wanted.</p><p id="""">And he decided to go all-in on a <strong id="""">secure data transfer service… using pigeons.</strong></p><p id="""">He started breaking down actual <strong id="""">success rates of pigeon deliveries</strong>, their <strong id="""">reproduction cycles</strong>, how long it takes to train them, and even how to encrypt messages onto pigeons.</p><p id="""">The audience was dying laughing. But at the same time, he delivered his pitch so convincingly that people were actually engaged.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s insane! What was his actual business pitch after that?</strong></p><p id="""">He was actually working in <strong id="""">banking and financial encryption technology</strong>—so the pigeon messaging concept was hilarious but oddly relevant.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s amazing. What about the inflatable arms pitch?</strong></p><p id="""">Oh, that one was great.</p><p id="""">The idea was <strong id="""">inflatable muscle arms</strong> for people who feel insecure at the pool. So instead of just regular floaties, they would look like buff, muscular arms.</p><p id="""">The founder completely ran with it. He talked about the psychological benefits, the social confidence boost, even how they could be <em id="""">customizable</em> for different muscle shapes.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s so ridiculous, but I love it.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s the beauty of <em id="""">Sh</em>t Pitch*—you never know what’s going to happen, but it pushes founders to <strong id="""">think on their feet</strong> and show who they really are.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">What’s Next for Sht Pitch?*</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">This is so good. So tell me, what’s on the horizon for Sht Pitch? What’s coming up next?*</strong></p><p id="""">We’re doubling down in 2025.</p><p id="""">Last year, we launched with 11 events across the country. This year, we’re doing 20 national events.</p><p id="""">We’re kicking off in New York, and we’ll be hitting major cities throughout the year. Then, we’ll close the season with a grand finale event in Utah—a two or three-day event featuring all the winners from every city.</p><p id="""">And we’re taking it a step further—we’re filming it as a TV pilot to pitch to major networks.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s huge! So this could turn into a full-fledged show?</strong></p><p id="""">That’s the goal. We’ve seen the impact these events have had, and we know there’s an audience for it.</p><p id="""">The challenge now is bringing it to an even bigger platform and continuing to connect founders with investors in the most authentic way possible.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s incredible. For anyone listening, where can they go to find upcoming events and get involved?</strong></p><p id="""">Everything is on <strong id="""">Sh*tPitch.com</strong>.</p><p id="""">You’ll find the <strong id="""">event schedule</strong>, details on how to participate, and opportunities for <strong id="""">investors, founders, and attendees</strong> to get involved.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Advice for Founders</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">This has been amazing. Before we wrap up, what’s your final piece of advice for founders—especially those looking to raise money?</strong></p><p id="""">Fail fast.</p><p id="""">If you’re sitting on an idea, don’t waste years trying to <em id="""">perfect</em> it. Talk to people, test the market, and find out <strong id="""">as quickly as possible</strong> if it’s viable.</p><p id="""">And don’t just talk to friends and family—they’ll either tell you it’s amazing (because they love you) or they’ll say it’s too ambitious (because they don’t understand your vision).</p><p id="""">Instead, <strong id="""">talk to people who are actually in the space</strong>—investors, operators, and people who’ve done it before.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a killer takeaway.

George Wright III here. I'm super excited today because we’ve got a gentleman with us who was recently featured in <em id="""">Valiant CEO Magazine</em>. He’s someone who is truly an innovator, and his name is James Pizzola.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">James Pizzola is a visionary leader and the CEO of a brand-new mobile app we’re going to discuss today. With over 10 years of experience in business strategy, leadership, and project management, he has a proven track record of driving growth, innovation, and success. But what really sets him apart is his passion for improving relationships, which inspired him to create this app.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The app is designed to help people navigate their relationships more effectively and make informed, data-driven decisions. Today, he’ll share with us his entrepreneurial journey, his perspective on authority, and his insights into relationships.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">James, welcome to the show, man!</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, thanks, George. I very much appreciate being here.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">This is exciting. I know we had a lot of conversations before the episode, and I get really fired up when I meet innovators like you. Building a business is often a lonely journey, and our audience is full of entrepreneurs, CEOs, and business owners. You’ve been successful in multiple ventures, so I’m looking forward to hearing your insights.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">James Pizzola's Background and Vision</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So why don’t you do me a favor and give me kind of a backdrop for our listeners? Where do you come from? What’s your key skill set? And then we’ll bridge over into where you’re headed now. Give us a bit of your background.</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. Yeah. So like you said, I’ve been in the IT space for about 10 years now, working as a product owner and project manager, developing software products and mobile applications. And I’ve always had a passion for psychology.</p><p id="""">I wanted to take that passion and blend it with the skills I’ve developed in the IT world to create something that many people could benefit from.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. What really excited me about having you on the show is that I’m a pretty analytical guy, too. Even though I teach and explore personal development and mindset, I’m still very analytical. I think a lot of people resonate with that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Having an engineering, detail-oriented background and then merging it with personal development—quite honestly, that’s why I started <em id="""">The Daily Mastermind</em>. I wanted to merge mindset and business. How do you get your mind right so you can succeed? I feel like you’re doing something similar with relationships. You’re breaking it down, analyzing it, and helping people be better.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">At the end of the day, we all want to have a better life. Was there a particular event in your life that drove you toward this passion, or was it more of an evolution of your business background?</strong></p><p id="""">That’s a great question, and I appreciate you asking. Like I mentioned, I’ve always been interested in why people do the things they do. Most of us are trying to make rational decisions in the moment with the information we have, but that can become difficult when emotions are running high.</p><p id="""">The way I came up with this idea was through my own experience. I was in a relationship with a woman I deeply cared about. I was in love with her, and we were together for a number of years. Toward the end of the relationship, things started to get strained. I won’t go into all the reasons, but it became contentious and difficult for both of us.</p><p id="""">I reached a point where I wanted to evaluate whether the relationship was still a net positive for me. Like many people in romantic, familial, or platonic relationships, I found it hard to separate emotions from rational, logical thinking. Friends might give advice, saying, “Is this relationship worth it for you?” But ultimately, you have to make that decision yourself.</p><p id="""">I was looking for a way to determine objectively whether the relationship was still beneficial. A lot of people go through rollercoaster dynamics—one day everything is great, the next there’s a huge argument, and then you make up, and it’s fantastic again. But is that rollercoaster really more beneficial than having a more even-keel, balanced interaction with someone?</p><p id="""">That’s why I developed this app. It helps users track their interactions and gather data on their relationships. This way, they can look back with clarity to see how they were feeling at specific times. More importantly, they can identify trends to determine whether the relationship is one to continue pursuing or whether there are issues that need to be addressed proactively before they spiral into negativity.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Man, I love that. I really do. And I want to dive into how you were able to translate these insights into technical terms. But before we do, let me ask this foundational question: Relationships are essential in both business and life.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The quality of your life is directly tied to your relationships, but most people agree relationships can feel ambiguous. They’re emotionally driven, not logical. So how do you measure something like that? Is it about measuring it, or is it about having indicators? Are there always going to be intangible elements? Or is the goal to provide a guidepost to help people navigate relationships better?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">How the Relationship App Works</strong></h3><p id="""">That’s a great question. There are a lot of nuances in relationships. What our app does is give users the opportunity to record various interactions they have.</p><p id="""">For example, you can log activities like going to the movies, going on a date, or attending a family reunion. You then rate the significance of the interaction and give it a score from 1 to 10.</p><p id="""">Let’s say you went grocery shopping with your partner. That’s a low-significance activity, but if you had a nice time, you might rate it a 7 out of 10. Conversely, if you had a heated argument about an important topic—like deciding where to live—that would be a high-significance interaction. If it didn’t go well, you might rate it a 3 out of 10.</p><p id="""">Over time, these inputs allow you to identify trends. Are your interactions generally positive? Are there recurring issues? This data helps users pinpoint where they’re aligning and where they’re off track.</p><p id="""">More importantly, it provides clarity. If things aren’t going well, you can assess whether the relationship is still beneficial for both parties or whether adjustments are needed to improve it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. It’s so interesting because I’ve been having conversations lately that align with what you’re saying. For our listeners, I want to double down on what you just mentioned. Relationships are one of our most valuable assets. They shape our lives just as much as our thoughts do.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I’ve often said that what you focus on grows, and what you measure improves. Your app lets people focus on their relationships and track them in a way that helps them grow and improve. It reminds me of something Brendan Burchard talks about—rating your life every day to see if you’re improving or not.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, this app doesn’t just measure interactions; it helps people focus on them and take them to the next level. Would you agree with that?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, absolutely. And in my own relationships, I’ve noticed something that many people go through as well. When a relationship ends—whether it’s romantic, familial, or platonic—you start to romanticize the good moments and forget the bad ones.</p><p id="""">This is why so many people go back to their exes. You convince yourself it wasn’t as bad as it felt at the time. But our app allows you to look back objectively at how you felt during specific moments in the relationship.</p><p id="""">It helps eliminate the distortion that emotions can create. You won’t downplay the negatives just because you’re lonely or minimize red flags because you’re hoping to reconcile. You’ll see a clear record of how things were, which empowers you to make better decisions.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Exactly. And it’s so true—our memories can be unreliable. Over time, we either magnify the bad or idealize the good, which distorts reality. Your app provides objectivity and clarity, which is critical for growth.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, walk me through how the app works step by step. What’s the process for someone using it? And who is your target audience?</strong></p><p id="""">Our app is designed for anyone who values relationships, which should ideally be everyone. But we’re particularly targeting people who want to improve the quality of their relationships—whether romantic, familial, or platonic.</p><p id="""">Here’s how it works:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Download the app:</strong> You can find it in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Set up your profile:</strong> Enter your details and start adding the key relationships in your life. This process takes about 30 to 45 seconds per relationship.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Log interactions:</strong> After any significant interaction—like going on a date, attending a family event, or having a discussion—you can log it in the app.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Rate and analyze:</strong> Rate the interaction’s significance and outcome. Over time, the app will track patterns and trends in your relationships.</li></ol><p id="""">If you’re working with a therapist, the app becomes even more valuable. You can share your interaction history with them, whether you’re in individual therapy, couples counseling, or family counseling.</p><p id="""">This gives therapists better insights into your dynamics, allowing them to provide more tailored guidance. It’s like a fitness tracker for your emotional health. Even if you don’t have a therapist, the app helps you analyze your relationships and identify areas for improvement.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Got it. That’s a brilliant analogy—like a fitness tracker for relationships. And it’s so valuable because the more objective data we have, the better decisions we can make.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But what I find fascinating is how this ties back to personal development. Relationships are crucial, but the relationship we have with ourselves is just as important. Are you incorporating that into the app as well?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, absolutely. One of the most important relationships anyone can have is with themselves. We’re developing assessments within the app that help users better understand their personality, relationship style, and interests.</p><p id="""">These assessments include:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Personality tests:</strong> Understanding your traits and tendencies.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Relationship style tests:</strong> Identifying how you interact in relationships.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Interest and hobby profiles:</strong> Gaining clarity on what you enjoy.</li></ul><p id="""">One exciting feature we’re working on is integrating the Big Five personality test and Carl Jung’s brand archetype assessment. These tools will help users identify what types of people they align with and what types they may struggle with.</p><p id="""">This will benefit not only personal relationships but professional ones as well. If someone is in a job or partnership that doesn’t align with their personality, this tool can provide valuable insights to help them make better choices.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Personal Development and Relationships</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. It’s so true. The relationship we have with ourselves impacts everything—our philosophy, how we approach relationships, and even how we filter experiences.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Starting with self-awareness and building outward to external relationships is so powerful. I think what you’re doing is dynamite. I’m excited to see how this develops. But let me ask you this—what motivated you to take this path? Is it about having an impact on the world, or is this something more personal for you?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s a combination of both. Honestly, what excites me most is the ability to help people build genuinely better connections.</p><p id="""">During COVID, I realized just how essential relationships are. For many of us, it was a very isolating time. If you were lucky enough to have someone with you, that was great. But for those who didn’t, it was incredibly lonely.</p><p id="""">That period really made me reflect on the quality of my own relationships. I wanted to ensure they were as strong and fulfilling as possible.</p><p id="""">Coming out of a relationship that didn’t work out also fueled my drive. I spent a lot of time processing what went wrong and asking myself whether something like this app could have helped us stay on track. Could we have recognized the issues earlier and addressed them before they became unmanageable?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a powerful motivator. And you mentioned something earlier that really struck me: people often move from one bad relationship to another because they don’t fully understand themselves. Is that something you’re addressing with the assessments you’re building?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. One of the biggest challenges is that many people don’t know themselves well enough to recognize what kind of person they should be with or what they truly need.</p><p id="""">The assessments we’re developing are designed to help users better understand themselves—things like their relationship style, personality type, and interests. For example, Carl Jung’s archetypes help identify compatibility with others.</p><p id="""">If someone repeatedly ends up in relationships with incompatible people, these tools can help them break that cycle. And it’s not just about romantic relationships; it applies to friendships, family dynamics, and even professional relationships.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s huge. It ties back to what I believe—that everything in your external world starts with your internal world. The better you know yourself, the better decisions you make in all areas of life. And that ripple effect improves your relationships, career, and overall quality of life.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. And that’s the goal—to create tools that empower people to improve their lives from the inside out. When you feel confident in who you are and understand what works for you, it has a positive impact on everything.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Man, I love this. We could probably talk for hours on this topic. But let me shift gears for a moment. A lot of business owners listen to this show, and they’re always looking for insights to grow their businesses.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Business Insights for CEOs</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">As a CEO, what do you think are the most important factors for driving growth and success in today’s market?</strong></p><p id="""">I think it’s twofold. First, I’ll draw from Jeff Bezos. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on an excellent customer experience, and I couldn’t agree more.</p><p id="""">If we can provide maximum value to our users, therapists, and everyone engaging with our app, it will do more for us than any other strategy. Creating an experience that people genuinely enjoy and find valuable is critical to building a loyal customer base.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Absolutely. This world thrives on instant gratification, but many businesses miss the long-term impact of creating real relationships with their customers. It’s easier to keep a customer than to gain a new one, and focusing on value ensures that customers stick around. What’s the second thing?</strong></p><p id="""">The second is something I’ve learned from Elon Musk. He focuses on identifying and solving the single biggest problem or bottleneck facing his companies.</p><p id="""">As a CEO, it’s tempting to get involved in everything. But if you can focus on the largest pain point or issue within your company, you’ll have the most significant impact.</p><p id="""">Smaller issues can be delegated to the team, but as the CEO, your responsibility is to tackle the most challenging problems. Whether it’s a technical bug, a marketing challenge, or a strategic pivot, addressing that one major roadblock can create momentum for the entire organization.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a powerful mindset. Working on the business rather than in the business is key to long-term growth. And focusing on solving the biggest bottleneck helps prioritize your energy where it matters most. It’s a game-changer for CEOs and entrepreneurs alike.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s about prioritizing your efforts and trusting your team to handle the smaller details. If you’re focused on the big picture and the critical issues, the entire organization benefits.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve hit the nail on the head. When you combine customer focus with strategic problem-solving, you create a solid foundation for growth. It also builds authority and trust, which are crucial in today’s market.

George Wright III here. I'm really excited to have Jason Moss with us today on the podcast. This is a gentleman that has really evolved from running and building and growing multiple businesses to actually becoming a coach and a mentor to business owners and entrepreneurs.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me give you a quick introduction. He's a multiple six-figure business coach, leads a community online of 20,000 coaches right now. He's been featured in Entrepreneur Magazine, Online Business Owner. He's had all kinds of featured articles, which we were just talking about the other day about being featured.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But he's got a really unique approach to business growth, which integrates your identity and strategies that you’ve got to use to grow your business. That’s why I wanted to bring him in because even though he coaches business coaches, he really has some principles of success that, having built businesses for over 20 years, are really unique for the audience. So Jason, welcome to the podcast.</strong></p><p id="""">Thanks so much, George. I’m glad to be here.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We got a chance to just get to know each other. And I’ll tell you, we share a lot of similar things. That’s one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on here. So give me a quick background because look, you made your first sale at 13 and you’ve been growing businesses ever since.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Identity in Business Growth</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So I had asked you before what brought you into the coaching business, but give everybody a little bit of a backdrop as to who you are, what drives you, and what your skill or natural talent is. Then we can jump into some of these core principles.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, I’ve always had a passion for really two things. I’ve always been this internet computer nerd. So I love the online world. I made my first sale online when I was, I think, 13 years old. I built this software program that was really designed to help me play video games without putting the CDs in the computer. If anybody remembers that, it was like whenever you wanted to play a game, you’d have to find the CD.</p><p id="""">So I built this program that basically made it so I could play my favorite video games without putting the CD in. That was the first product I ever sold online. But I’ve also had a really strong passion for communication, and so much of marketing, as I see it, is really just human connection. It’s relationships. It’s understanding people.</p><p id="""">So really, my journey over the past 20 years has been merging those two things together and building platforms online—from that first product business when I was 13, selling software, to building a platform as a musician when I was in high school on MySpace, to helping grow a multi-seven-figure business as a director of sales, to the work I do today as a business coach.</p><p id="""">So it’s been many different niches and many different roads, but I think the common thread through all of them has been this passion for connecting with people. Also, just using these amazing tools that we have today—this world of internet marketing and the amazing technology, the ways that we have to reach people—to connect with people all around the world and make an impact through the work I do.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, no, I tell you, you have a rare and unique background. When I say that, I mean a lot of people have various channels of knowledge, but having been in sales, marketing, running a business, starting a business, programming—all those things—you bring a great perspective, which is why I can see why you are now coaching and mentoring business owners.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">One of the reasons I really wanted to have you here is I love the perspective you have on this idea that you’ve got to grow from the inside out. You talk about how to scale your business because everybody is looking at ways to brand, grow, and scale their business. I want you to talk to us about this. On one hand, I thought we could get into strategies and tactics, but I really felt the best value we could bring is to talk about how businesses can scale using the identity of that next level of income.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So tell me what you mean by that and help our listeners understand what it takes to do that.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, it’s a great question. It’s probably one of the things I’m most excited to talk about because it’s 90 percent of entrepreneurship as I understand it today. To be honest, most of this was born from frustration for me because I started my career as a business coach providing people primarily with strategic business support.</p><p id="""">I would give people the marketing plans and help them dial in their social media strategy. I still do a lot of that today. But what would drive me nuts is I would give the same plan, the same roadmap, to two different coaches. One person would take that and triple their revenue in six months, and the other would stay exactly where they are. For years, I was like, “First, am I just a crappy coach? What is the thing?”</p><p id="""">And then on a deeper level, I was like, ""What does it actually take? If it's really about strategy—if strategy is really the missing piece—then why is it that most of us already have access to the strategies but still don't see the success we want?""</p><p id="""">As I started exploring this, both in my own life as well as with the clients I was working with, I began to understand on a deeper level that we all have two sides. We've got the inner and the outer. The inner is identity—beliefs, mindsets, the inner world, how you see yourself and your business. The outer is the strategy, the business plan, the growth hacks, all the external pieces.</p><p id="""">Most people, when they think about growing a business, spend 80 to 90 percent of their time—if not 100 percent—exclusively focused on the external. They’re asking, ""How do I figure out the right marketing strategy? How do I put together the right content plan?"" They wonder why it doesn’t work.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, and they want that thing. They want that strategy, that tactic, that silver bullet, whatever it is. But you’re right. They don’t realize it’s the inner game.</strong></p><p id="""">And we sell those strategies because they sell. People want to hear about them, so I talk about them. But the thing I started to see with the clients I worked with, as well as in my own life, is this:</p><p id="""">Last year, for example, our business did around $500,000 in sales. I was at this level where I hit a plateau. I was really in this incremental shift and change kind of place. I was optimizing—asking, ""How do I do a little more of what I’m doing now? How do I optimize this?"" It was fine; it was an important part of business.</p><p id="""">But I realized I had created a bottleneck because I was operating with the identity of a multi-six-figure coach. I was operating at that level. The ideas, the thinking, and the beliefs I had were all reflections of that identity. Even the strategies available to me from that mindset were reflections of that identity.</p><p id="""">A lot of people don’t think about this. They say, ""I want to grow my business to seven figures or multiple seven figures."" But if you think of yourself as a six-figure coach or a multi-six-figure business owner, you won’t even be available to the strategy that will take you to the next level. You literally won’t see it. Your mind will filter it out.</p><p id="""">Six months ago, I made the commitment. One day I was laying in bed, and I said, ""You know what? It’s time."" I was praying, saying, ""God, I’m available. I’m open. I’m ready. I am ready to become the seven-figure coach. I don’t even know what that looks like, but I’m committing to the identity. I’m committing to becoming the kind of person who can hold the level of success that I want.""</p><p id="""">Over the last six months, everything has changed. This month alone, we’re walking out of a $100,000 launch. Everything has shifted.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">And what’s fascinating is that the strategy feels like it’s fallen into my lap. But it wasn’t intellectual. I didn’t think my way into it. The first thing I did was commit to who I needed to become in order to hold the business I wanted. Suddenly, ideas became available. Things I heard from mentors years ago suddenly clicked into place.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It all comes back, yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, it all came back. What I’ve realized is that growing a business is an inside-out process. My job as an entrepreneur is to focus primarily on expanding myself to become the person I need to be to create the business externally. It’s 80 percent internal and 20 percent external. The more I focus on the inside, the more the outside naturally aligns to match that inner state.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it’s funny. It’s such a parallel path to what I’ve seen in my career. I tell people this a lot: success leaves clues. I’ve worked with and been around some of the biggest names in business, and it’s always the same. They’ve come to that realization about inner game. But it’s not until you build on those beliefs and work through the inner struggles that everything external becomes possible.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, and it’s not until you really deal with those limiting beliefs, practice visualization, and start doing the inner work that everything you need starts to align externally. Those strategies and tactics matter, don’t get me wrong. But the difference-maker is your internal thermometer, your blueprint. Without that, you’ll never reach the scalability you’re aiming for. It’s essential.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what do you think is the biggest obstacle that holds people back? We’ve come to this realization through our own experiences, but what keeps others from making this internal shift? What are the hurdles you see most often?</strong></p><p id="""">The biggest obstacle, without a doubt, is that as a culture and society, we’re so fixated on the external. We discount the internal. We talk about mindset, but when you really look at how most entrepreneurs spend their time and energy, they’re focused entirely on external strategies.</p><p id="""">That fixation has conditioned us to believe the solution is always “out there.” It’s always about finding the next tactic, the next trend, the next big thing. People keep chasing that silver bullet.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it’s the conditioning, the idea that “it’s just one more thing I need.”</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. And here’s the problem: when you’ve been on that hamster wheel long enough, you start to realize it doesn’t work. You hit a ceiling. You start to feel like you’re recreating the same patterns in your business, your relationships, or your life.</p><p id="""">And that’s when the deeper roadblocks appear—the fears, the limiting beliefs, the stories we tell ourselves. They’re all manifestations of fear: fear of success, fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of rejection. All of it keeps us in this box we’ve created for ourselves.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, fear is huge.</strong></p><p id="""">It’s massive. People say they want to grow their business to $10 million a year, but then you start digging deeper, and there’s resistance. Maybe it’s fear of outgrowing their current relationships. Maybe it’s fear of being criticized by their family or peers. Whatever it is, there’s this subconscious push-pull energy that creates self-sabotage.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You nailed it. Most people don’t realize they’re validating their limiting beliefs by staying in that cycle. They’re saying, “See? It doesn’t work.” But it’s because their actions aren’t aligned with their words.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Their words and their actions are out of sync because deep down, they don’t believe in their own success.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s right. And it’s not until they really address those beliefs, remove those fears, and start acting in alignment with their goals that they begin to see different results. They have to believe it’s possible for them before their actions will truly reflect that belief.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. And the moment you align those actions with genuine belief, things shift. It’s like flipping a switch. The resistance fades, and you move forward with clarity and purpose.</p><p id=""""> </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Four Pillars of Business</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I completely agree. Now, you also talk about four pillars that businesses should focus on to optimize and scale. Walk us through those four pillars and how they apply to entrepreneurs trying to get to the next level.</strong></p><p id="""">Sure thing. The four pillars I always emphasize are niche, offer, audience, and enrollment. These are foundational for any personal brand-driven or service-based business, especially for coaches or consultants. Let’s break them down:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Niche</strong> – This is about who you serve. It’s critical to get specific. A lot of people think they know their niche, but they’re still too broad. You can’t speak to everyone, so you need to deeply understand the pain points, desires, and goals of your audience.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Offer</strong> – This is about creating something that truly resonates. Your offer should solve a clear problem for your niche. It’s not just about what you think is valuable; it’s about what your audience finds valuable and is willing to invest in.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Audience</strong> – This is about building a community or platform. You can’t just rely on direct response tactics where you’re always chasing the next sale. Instead, focus on nurturing relationships with your audience over time. Create trust and value consistently.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Enrollment</strong> – This is the process of turning interest into action. Whether it’s sales calls, webinars, or other methods, you need a clear system for helping your audience make the decision to work with you.</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that framework. And you’re right, most entrepreneurs know these areas but don’t go deep enough into them. They dabble instead of mastering them. What do you think holds them back from doing that?</strong></p><p id="""">Honestly, I think it’s a lack of clarity and focus. They think they know their niche, but they haven’t tested it deeply. They have an offer, but it’s not dialed into what their audience really needs. And without building genuine relationships with their audience, their enrollment process feels transactional instead of transformational.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That makes so much sense. Now, you also talk about achieving greater income with alignment and flow instead of grinding harder. Can you expand on that?</strong></p><p id="""">Of course. There’s this myth that to make more money, you need to work harder and longer hours. But in reality, it’s about operating from a place of flow. Flow happens when you’re aligned with your purpose and you’re doing work that feels natural and energizing.</p><p id="""">One of my mentors, Scott Oldford, introduced me to the concept of three levels of consciousness in business: willful, intellectual, and intuitive.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Willful</strong> is about grinding and hustling. It’s where most people start, and it’s important to develop that discipline early on. But it’s not sustainable.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Intellectual</strong> is the next level, where you start strategizing and optimizing. You look at data, create systems, and build efficiency into your business.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Intuitive</strong> is the highest level, where you’re aligned with your purpose and passions. You trust your instincts, and decisions flow naturally. At this level, you don’t force things; you let them unfold.</li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a powerful framework. And it makes sense because as you grow, you can’t stay in hustle mode forever. You have to shift to systems and intuition.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. When you reach the intuitive level, you’re not just working harder—you’re working smarter and more in tune with what feels right. That’s when you truly find flow, and success feels effortless.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. What would you say to someone who’s ready to make that shift but doesn’t know where to start?</strong></p><p id="""">Start by getting curious about your recurring patterns. Look for the areas where you’re hitting the same roadblocks over and over again. Those are clues. They’ll show you the limiting beliefs or fears that are holding you back.</p><p id="""">Once you identify those patterns, start doing the inner work to address them. That might mean hiring a coach, doing mindset exercises, or even journaling to uncover what’s beneath the surface.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Great advice.

We’ve got a really good topic today—one that I’ve been familiar with for a while. It’s great that we’re finally able to get together because I want to share some topics today that you’re an expert at. With The Daily Mastermind, we’re always talking about ways people can increase their life and their lifestyle—whether it’s their mind, money, body, or business. This episode is going to be one of those wealth planning discussions.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">If you don’t know Dale, he’s a seasoned real estate investor specializing in U.S. tax liens and tax deeds. He’s also one of the founders of Certainty Investment Group, a firm known for providing investors with 12–15% annual returns fully secured by real estate. Dale is passionate about simplifying the often complex state and county tax sale process. This conversation dives into what many consider one of the best-kept secrets of the high net worth—tax liens and deeds.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Understanding Tax Liens and Deeds</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Could you start out by giving us a bit of your background? You started pursuing bank foreclosures before moving into tax liens and deeds. What brought you into this whole category of investing?</strong></p><p id="""">I started out as a realtor—I’ve been a realtor in three states—and soon after, I got involved in investing, typically with bank foreclosures. That’s where I started. I remember attending one of the many county auctions, and on the side, I noticed guys doing a different type of sale from the sheriff’s department. This was many years ago. I inquired about it, and it just fascinated me.</p><p id="""">Tax sales have been going on for over 200 years, and many are still done the same way today. There are over a thousand jurisdictions that conduct tax sales—some every month, some just a few times a year. Every state has different rules, and even counties within the same state can have their own variations. Some cities and jurisdictions even run their own processes. It can be quite a daunting and complicated system.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’ve noticed that, especially over the years, talking with people trying to expand their retirement portfolio or investments. There are so many things you just don’t realize. Maybe for those unfamiliar with tax liens and deeds, give us a little understanding of what that is and how the process works before we get into the details of what your company does.</strong></p><p id="""">Tax liens and deeds are the way states and counties operate. They fund schools, city services—everything. It’s really the <strong id="""">lifeblood of counties and jurisdictions.</strong> Every year, property owners have taxes to pay, and some fall behind. After a certain point—depending on the state—they put the property up for sale through auctions. That’s where investors like myself come in to buy either the <strong id="""">tax liens or the tax deeds.</strong></p><blockquote id=""""><em id="""">“Tax sales have been going on for over 200 years, and they’re still one of the most reliable ways to invest if you know how to do it.”</em></blockquote><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Why Tax Liens Offer Guaranteed Returns</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">A lot of people don’t really understand that there’s a lot of complexity to it. And they also don’t understand that there are guaranteed returns involved. Why is it that you can say there are guaranteed returns for these liens and deeds?</strong></p><p id="""">Especially when referring to liens—also called <strong id="""">tax certificates</strong>—each state sets its own rates. Some states offer 8%, others 14%, 15%, even up to 20%. These are <strong id="""">mandated rates of return by the state.</strong> We do a lot of that, and we also deal in tax deeds where you actually buy the property and get a deed to it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And you guys have been doing this for a while—you know where to go and what to do.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s right. Experience makes all the difference in this space.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Challenges in Tax Lien and Deed Investing</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What kind of challenges do people face when they jump into this market with this type of investing?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s a tedious process. The state gives you very little information on the property other than the legal description. You’ve got to find out everything on your own—whether it has other liens, what the physical condition is, or if the property even exists.</p><p id="""">Sometimes the county provides a picture, but most don’t. And even if they do, that photo might be three or four years old, maybe pulled from Google Maps or Zillow. You really have to look at every property yourself. Otherwise, you might buy something that’s in terrible condition and not realize it until it’s too late.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve got a good example of this, right? People think they can jump in on their own and don’t realize the challenges. Could you share a story of when that happened?</strong></p><p id="""">Many examples come to mind, but there’s one famous story about a father-and-son team in Florida. They thought they were buying a beautiful, expensive home at an auction. But what they actually bought was the <em id="""">strip of land between that property and the next one.</em> It was just wide enough to fit a lawn chair. They even filmed themselves sitting there in front of the house they <em id="""">thought</em> they owned.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow! I think a lot of people feel like they can just dive in without learning from the experience of others. Like you said, it’s a complex process. So help us understand—what makes tax lien and deed investing so much different than traditional real estate strategies, in terms of opportunity and risk?</strong></p><p id="""">It can be extremely lucrative, but it’s also very hands-on. Sometimes you can get property for ten to twenty cents on the dollar. But you’ve got to do a ton of research and due diligence beforehand. You have to physically inspect each property.</p><p id="""">For example, at the last auction I attended, there were about 150 properties. I determined 75 might be decent targets, did my due diligence on those, and personally visited over 50. Then, right before the auction, many property owners paid their taxes—sometimes even on the last day—and those properties were pulled from the sale.</p><p id="""">That’s just part of the process. You might have to evaluate 50 to 100 properties to get one or two solid deals.</p><blockquote id=""""><em id="""">“It’s not a get-rich-quick system; it’s a research-and-diligence system that rewards patience and precision.”</em></blockquote><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Certainty Investment Group: A Unique Approach</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Your company, Certainty Investment Group, offers investors 12 to 15% returns that are guaranteed and secured by real estate. How can you achieve those kinds of consistent, safe returns with this type of investing?</strong></p><p id="""">Tax sales can be very lucrative if done properly. If you acquire properties at a good enough price, you can afford to pay investors 12 to 15% and still maintain profitability. You just have to be careful and disciplined.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Unlike many in this industry—where you’ve got gurus and educators selling “how-to” courses—you decided not to go that route. You handle all the due diligence and inspections for your investors instead. Why did you build your business this way, and how does it set you apart from others in the industry?</strong></p><p id="""">We’ve always been hands-on from the start. We didn’t want to just teach people how to do this. We wanted to provide a complete service. It’s a “set it and forget it” type of investment. We handle all the due diligence, physical inspections, and acquisition steps. Our investors simply enjoy an attractive return without the stress of doing the legwork themselves.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s great. You mentioned earlier that photos online often don’t tell the full story. How do you make sure your team gets an accurate picture before making investment decisions?</strong></p><p id="""">We start with online research, but then we visit every property in person and take our own photos. These aren’t open houses—these are potential tax sales, often occupied or vacant. We verify occupancy, assess roof and structure conditions, check electrical systems, and make a rough estimate of any needed repairs.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That level of hands-on work clearly helps reduce risk.</strong></p><p id="""">It really does. It’s what gives us our edge and helps protect our investors.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Market Insights and Investment Strategies</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What do you see happening in the industry right now? Do you see things shifting in any particular direction? You’ve got a pretty good pulse on the market. Where do you do most of your investing?</strong></p><p id="""">We specialize primarily in Arkansas, Mississippi, and some parts of Texas. Those are our key markets.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Have those markets changed much recently? What’s the overall state of the marketplace right now? A lot of people wonder if the timing is right or if current conditions affect this kind of investing.</strong></p><p id="""">Tax sales happen every year, regardless of the economy. People get behind on taxes in every type of market. This system has been around for 200 years, and that hasn’t changed. It might increase slightly during tough economies, but overall, tax sales continue steadily no matter what’s happening in the broader market.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s interesting—it’s one of those spaces that isn’t directly tied to traditional market swings. So, what type of investors generally work best with this kind of opportunity? Are they people looking for a fixed return rather than active real estate investors?</strong></p><p id="""">Most of our investors are individuals who want a steady, attractive return without the hassle. Many of them have <strong id="""">self-directed IRAs</strong>, which can be invested in alternative assets like tax liens and deeds. They want their money working for them but don’t have the time or desire to manage the properties themselves.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That makes sense—people with existing retirement accounts or busy entrepreneurs who prefer a passive approach.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Investing in tax sales can be a full-time job. It requires a lot of research and travel. Most people are too busy running their own lives or businesses to do that. That’s where we come in: we take on the heavy lifting so they can earn a <strong id="""">safe, consistent return</strong>.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Real-Life Examples and Returns</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Can you give an example of a deal that went really well—something that shows how these liens and deeds can pay off in a big way?</strong></p><p id="""">Just last week, we had a great example. I evaluated 50 properties across three different counties, went through the entire auction process, and picked up a few great deals. One of them was a <strong id="""">6,000-square-foot commercial building</strong>. Believe it or not, we got it for less than <strong id="""">$10,000</strong>.</p><p id="""">The county had it appraised at over <strong id="""">$137,000</strong>, and although it needs some work, it’s still an incredible return.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s amazing. And you’re able to do that consistently because of the due diligence and systems you’ve built.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. At that same auction, I personally visited over 50 properties and ended up buying just three or four. That’s the reality of the process—you evaluate a lot of opportunities to find a few strong ones. But when you do, the results can be phenomenal.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Do you provide education for people who want to start investing this way, or is it primarily a hands-off experience for your clients?</strong></p><p id="""">We focus on managing the investments directly for our clients. We’re not in the education business. There are plenty of others who offer “how-to” courses. We prefer to handle everything for our investors. That said, we’re happy to answer questions and explain how the process works for those investing with us.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What would you say are some of the common mistakes investors make when they try to start doing this themselves, and how can they avoid them?</strong></p><p id="""">The biggest mistake is getting overly excited by what they see in webinars or online. There are plenty of programs that make this look easy. People rush in, sign up for an online auction, and buy without ever inspecting the property.</p><p id="""">That’s where trouble starts. You have to do your <strong id="""">own due diligence</strong>—physically visit and inspect each property. The process is simple, but it’s not easy. You can’t rely solely on photos or assumptions.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Right, like anything in real estate—it’s about doing the homework. And if you don’t have time to learn every detail, that’s when partnering with experts like you makes sense. So, what’s the biggest value your company provides to investors? Why should someone choose to work with you?</strong></p><p id="""">We know what we’re doing. We’ve been doing it for years. We buy properties the right way, and every investment we make is fully secured. Investors earn 12 to 15% returns and receive <strong id="""">quarterly reports</strong> on how their investments are performing.</p><p id="""">It’s truly a <strong id="""">set-it-and-forget-it</strong> model. They don’t have to worry about the process—we handle everything.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Conclusion and Contact Information</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">If people want to get in touch with you or connect with your company, what’s the easiest way for them to do that?</strong></p><p id="""">The best way is through our website: <a href=""https://certaintyinvestmentgroup.com/"" id="""">CertaintyInvestmentGroup.com</a>. It’s got plenty of information, including videos that explain what we do. Visitors can also call us directly if they prefer to speak one-on-one.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Perfect. I’ll make sure to include all of that in the show notes. So, for those listening—if you’re interested in tax lien or deed investing but don’t want to deal with the complexity, or if you’ve tried real estate investing before and want a safer, more predictable path—check out Dale and his team.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">They’ve got a great system, and from what we’ve discussed today, it’s one of the most overlooked yet powerful wealth strategies available.</strong></p><p id="""">If you’ve been curious about tax liens or deeds, visit our website and give us a call. We’re happy to answer questions anytime. Just remember to do your due diligence—research the process, understand the basics, and make sure you’re comfortable with how everything works.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I completely agree. Like anything in investing, due diligence is key—whether it’s researching the opportunity or the people you’re working with. And that’s why conversations like this are so valuable.</strong></p><p id="""">Life and investing can both be complicated, and it’s always best to work with a specialist. There are so many ways to invest in real estate, but I truly believe <strong id="""">tax sales and deeds are one of the most lucrative paths when done right.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s exactly why we wanted to bring this topic to our listeners today. It’s something that’s been around for hundreds of years, yet most people still don’t know about it. The reality is, many of the secrets of the wealthy aren’t taught in school—they’re learned through connections, experience, and conversations like this.</strong></p><p id="""">It’s interesting, too, because many hedge funds and large banks—like Bank of America and JPMorgan—invest heavily in tax liens. They do it because the returns are guaranteed and secured by real collateral. These institutions invest <strong id="""">millions at a time</strong> because the strategy is stable and reliable.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That says a lot. If the biggest financial institutions in the world are using this approach to generate guaranteed returns, that’s worth paying attention to.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s one of the few investment strategies where the <strong id="""">risk is measurable and the returns are predictable.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. And to everyone reading—if you’ve been thinking about building wealth or growing your investments, tax liens and deeds are definitely something to explore. As always, remember—it’s never too late to start living the life you’re meant to live and doing the things you want to do.</strong></p><p id="""">If you’ve thought about investing and want to grow your wealth safely, this is a powerful option. Visit Certainty Investment Group, do your homework, and take the next step.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">We’ll link everything in the notes, and as always—stay intentional, stay focused, and we’ll see you in the next episode of <em id="""">The Authority Formula Podcast.</em></strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">About George Wright III:</strong></h4><p id="""">George Wright III is a Proven, Successful Entrepreneur- and he knows how to inspire entrepreneurs, companies, and individuals to achieve Massive Results.

He’s done it all. A few years ago, he published his book, <em id="""">Cut It Out: Getting Your Head Straight in Network Marketing</em>. With over 30 years of experience in networking, he has faced struggles, setbacks, and victories that serve as a testament to perseverance, self-mastery, and relentless pursuit.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Today, we’re diving into his journey—mental shifts, breaking through self-doubt, and overcoming obstacles. So if that’s okay with you, Gabriel, let’s get right into it.</strong></p><p id="""">Let's do it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Awesome.</strong></p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Gabriel’s Early Life and Challenges</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Just so people can get to know you a little bit more, let’s start with your journey. You’ve spent nearly 30 years in networking. Take us back to the beginning. What drew you into the industry? And what really drives you as an entrepreneur? Give us some background.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, thank you for that. Growing up, it’s amazing how crises can steer you. They either break people or make people.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">And so growing up, my father was much older than my mother. Back in the early ‘70s, they had the big swine flu outbreak.</p><p id="""">He got the shot, and I think I was two or three years old when he developed Guillain-Barré syndrome. My mother jumped up, ran into the living room, and there he was—on the couch, suffocating. The ambulance came and from that moment on, my life revolved around hospitals and nursing homes.</p><p id="""">For seven years—from age two to nine—it was suction machines, emergency phone calls, and my father enduring 16 operations. He was paralyzed from the waist down, his voice destroyed, unable to eat normal food. My image of a father figure—of a leader—was completely different from most.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">Now, in the background, my dad was a world leader. He was imprisoned in Auschwitz for six years—three of them in solitary confinement—because he refused to turn in his fellow prisoners or deny his belief in Christ.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">He wasn’t Jewish, but he had a tremendous amount of influence. He was the youngest member in the history of the Czech Parliament, spoke seven languages, and changed lives. He evaded Panzer tank divisions and rescued children across the border. I still have boxes full of his documents and letters in Czech.</p><p id="""">As a little kid, he was my hero. But there he was—paralyzed in a hospital bed.</p><p id="""">So, in my young mind, I processed that all greatness ended in futility. I could strive, succeed, reach the top of my game, do something amazing… but deep down, I created an internal self-sabotage mechanism. Every time I got to the point of breakthrough, I would unconsciously do something to destroy it. I didn’t even realize I was doing it. It became a pattern—because I didn’t believe anything good would last.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">So my life was like this roller coaster. Here I am, right?</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">First Encounter with Network Marketing</strong></h2><p id="""">I was 18, 19 years old. A couple of mentors from church spoke into my life, but my first real introduction to network marketing happened when a friend invited me to a meeting.</p><p id="""">A lady in Atlanta flew in on a pink jet to Peachtree DeKalb Airport. The company was called Rosemary, and we all sat in the back of a Denny’s. Remember when you could sit in the back of Denny’s all night, drinking coffee for 12 straight hours?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oh yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, we would do that. Then came Barley Green, and finally, right when I turned 18, I jumped into AL Williams Prime America.</p><p id="""">At that time, I got my insurance license and was planning to go for my Series 6. Funny story—I had this giant head of curly hair, and they used to call me Cream of Wheat, not Buckwheat. I drove a‘67 Le Mans convertible, led meetings, and thought I was cool. But when people met me in person, they’d go, <em id="""">""This is the guy I talked to on the phone?""</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s hilarious.</strong></p><p id="""">But the moment that really shifted my life? I was in a room, getting my feet wet in network marketing, when this man walked in with his family. His last name was Vigilante.</p><p id="""">He was a godly man. His wife walked in beside him, holding onto him in a way I had never seen before. The way she looked at him. The way their kids interacted with him. It imprinted something on me. It was stability—something I had never seen in my life.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">He said, <em id="""">""Hey guys, we're here. We're about to head to the islands. But if you need anything, I’m here for you.""</em></p><p id="""">I watched them interact, and it hit me. I was raised in Buckhead, Atlanta, where success meant driving a Mercedes by age five and working for IBM or Coca-Cola. Six figures a year was the dream.</p><p id="""">But this man? He had fruit in his life that I had never seen. Clear eyes, a peaceful wife, kids who loved and respected him.</p><p id="""">And in that moment, I believe it was the beginning of my healing journey from being a self-saboteur.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s powerful.</strong></p><p id="""">It all started because I saw a successful man walk in—free from the noise, truly living his life. That was a massive wake-up call for me.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Positive Influences</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s interesting you say that because, on one hand, you’ve gone through a list of challenges, obstacles, and struggles, but you said it in such a simple, happy way that it almost makes it sound easy. And we know that wasn’t the case. So I have to ask—what positive influences helped you along the way? What kept you going during all of that?</strong></p><p id="""">I think one of the biggest motivations was hating the alternative—continuing the struggle.</p><p id="""">Number two, I never saw happy people who had that so-called ""success."" The ones with the big houses? They were all strapped financially, giving their families nothing but scraps of their time and energy.</p><p id="""">But I think the biggest thing? God touched my life. I can’t and won’t deny that. That was the most pivotal moment. When God moves, He shows you things, and it breaks strongholds in your life that nothing else can.</p><p id="""">And I was also blessed to have a few key people—men who saw value in me, spoke life into me, and actually cared enough to notice me.</p><p id="""">Many people go their whole lives without ever having someone speak life into them.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s interesting is that nowadays, the most successful people I’ve known, much like yourself, actively seek that influence. If you don’t look for it, you won’t find it. But in today’s world, it’s a little easier to surround yourself with positivity—with access to the internet, mentors, and personal development.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s true. But there are pros and cons to that, which leads us into an important topic—mindset.</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Mindset and Self-Worth in Entrepreneurship</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s dive into mindset because this is something you talk about a lot. You’ve worked with so many people over the years, and I know you’ve seen this play out. The battle entrepreneurs face is often in their minds—the roadblocks, the limiting beliefs. What do you think are some of the biggest mental obstacles holding people back? And how do you help them overcome that battle between their ears?</strong></p><p id="""">Great question. That’s why I mentioned self-sabotage earlier.</p><p id="""">People have imprints in life—unconscious limits on how far they think they can go. Whether it’s a dollar figure, lifestyle, or personal goal, many people have these invisible ceilings.</p><p id="""">Unless those internal watermarks are broken, that’s as far as they’ll ever go.</p><p id="""">Another big one? People give to their own demise.</p><p id="""">So many people would give the shirt off their backs, sacrifice for everyone else—but when it comes to receiving, they shut down. They struggle to do something for themselves.</p><p id="""">I see this a lot with women. Nurturing and giving come naturally to them. I had a client—very successful—who would buy Louis Vuitton handbags as gifts for others but wouldn’t dare buy one for herself.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">And it wasn’t about the bag. It was about her self-worth.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what’s the shift that needs to happen? What do you say to someone like that?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s like a tattoo—you can’t just wash it off. You have to burn it away.</p><p id="""">The first step is awareness.</p><p id="""">What gets revealed gets healed.</p><p id="""">Unless you acknowledge the issue, you can’t change it. We all have blind spots.</p><p id="""">For self-worth issues, I tell people to start rewarding themselves. Even if it’s something small, like buying a wallet.</p><p id="""">Every time you pull that wallet out, you remind yourself, <em id="""">""My labor produced this.""</em></p><p id="""">And over time, it builds—“I bought this jacket for myself. I bought this car for myself.” It’s not about material things. It’s about breaking that cycle of self-denial.</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Overcoming Fear of Judgment</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. And let’s be real—one of the biggest things holding people back is fear of judgment. Whether it’s fear of failure, fear of criticism, or just worrying about what people think. What do you say to someone who is paralyzed by that fear?</strong></p><p id="""">First of all, the fact that it affects people so profoundly proves how badly we crave the opinions of others.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yes.</strong></p><p id="""">We do need validation and support. Healthy opinions matter. The key is finding the right opinions.</p><p id="""">You’ve heard phrases like, “Other people’s opinions don’t pay your bills.” But here’s the reality—if someone’s opinion can derail your life, make sure they’re paying your bills 10years from now.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah.</strong></p><p id="""">And when you realize that, you have to ask yourself: <em id="""">Why was my heart’s soil available for their words to take root?</em></p><p id="""">That’s a whole other conversation.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a powerful reframe. And I like what you said about finding your why. Clarity and focus drown out the noise. The more clear you are about your mission, the less you care about opinions.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Obstacles don’t exist if you love big enough.</p><p id="""">Imagine you’re sitting by the pool, drinking sweet tea. Your child is playing outside, and suddenly, a vicious dog runs toward them.</p><p id="""">Do you sit there thinking, ""Oh, it’s hot, I don’t have my shoe son, where should I put my drink?"" No.</p><p id="""">You scale the fence, sprint across the yard, and handle the situation without hesitation.</p><p id="""">That’s what happens when you love something big enough—all the distractions disappear.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a great analogy. And it really does come down to focus. If you’re dialed in on your purpose, you’re too busy to care about opinions.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. The problem isn’t the seed. It’s the soil.</p><p id="""">People aren’t broken. Their environment is.</p><p id="""">I read about a study where scientists took a barren acre in the middle of a desert and irrigated it. Within weeks, plants started growing that hadn’t been seen in over a thousand years.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The seed wasn’t the problem. The soil was.</strong></p><p id="""">If you’re struggling, change your environment. Surround yourself with people who speak life into you.</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Practical Steps for Change</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such an important take away. So, for someone reading this thinking, ""I’m stuck. I want to change my life."" What are some practical steps they can take?</strong></p><p id="""">I always start with social media.</p><p id="""">I ask people to show me their profiles. If it’s full of negativity, political rants, or nonsense—guess what? That’s repelling opportunities.</p><p id="""">If you want to change your life, start by assessing where you are.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, because people don’t realize that their external world reflects their internal state.</strong></p><p id="""">Correct. Second, audit your relationships.</p><p id="""">Who are the five people you spend the most time with? Are they uplifting or draining you?</p><p id="""">If your environment is toxic, you need to remove yourself from it—at least temporarily.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And that’s why the networking space has been powerful for so many people. It forces positive association and growth.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Change your friends, and you change your life.</p><h2 id="""">&nbsp;</h2><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">The Power of Environment</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">You made a great point earlier—sometimes, people think they know what’s holding them back, but they’re not looking in the right place. They’re focusing on external factors instead of the internal game.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s not about chasing success. It’s about becoming the type of person who attracts success.</p><p id="""">Think about it—if a tree isn’t producing fruit, the problem isn’t the seed. It’s the soil. You have to change the environment.</p><p id="""">I’ve seen people with so much potential get stuck in toxic relationships, bad habits, and negative self-talk. And they wonder why they can’t break through.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, and I think people underestimate how much their environment impacts their mindset. If you surround yourself with small thinkers, you’ll stay small. If you surround yourself with high achievers, you start thinking bigger.</strong></p><p id="""">100%. The problem isn’t what’s in you. The problem is where you are planted.</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Overcoming Fear of Judgment</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">Another big thing people struggle with—especially in today’s world of social media—is the fear of judgment. People are so afraid of what others will think. How do you help someone break free from that?</strong></p><p id="""">First, we have to acknowledge that we all crave approval.</p><p id="""">If you’re deeply affected by other people’s opinions, that means their words have power over you. And that’s a problem.</p><p id="""">But here’s the thing—no one’s opinion should have more power over your life than your own convictions.</p><p id="""">I tell people this: <em id="""">If someone’s opinion is strong enough to knock you off course, make sure they’re paying your bills ten years from now.</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a strong reframe. And it’s true—most of the people whose opinions we worry about aren’t even invested in our success.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. And if their words can paralyze you, that means your ""why"" isn’t big enough.</p><p id="""">People say, <em id="""">“You need a why that makes you cry.”</em> No.</p><p id="""">You need a why that makes you take action.</p><p id="""">Look at your family. Look at your future. If you’re letting someone else’s opinion hold you back, you need to reevaluate what matters most.</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Words of Encouragement</strong></h2><p id=""""><strong id="""">This has been an incredible conversation. Before we wrap up, what’s one final piece of advice you’d give to someone reading this who feels stuck?</strong></p><p id="""">I want you to know—there’s hope.</p><p id="""">Whether you’re a millionaire looking for more meaning, someone who hasn’t made their first sale, or a person entering a new chapter of life, you are not mean to live the same day over and over again.</p><p id="""">Life isn’t about just getting by. You were created for something greater.</p><p id="""">Miles Munroe said, <em id="""">“The purpose of a thing is in the mind of the maker of a thing. And unless a thing is used for the purpose its maker intended, abuse is inevitable.”</em></p><p id="""">You were created for a purpose. Success is possible.</p><p id="""">And if you’ve hit a wall, I promise you—you can break through.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. And sometimes, people just need to hear it.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s right. If you’re reading this, know that you are capable of more than you think<strong id="""">.</strong> And I haven’t even shared a tenth of my story.</p><p id="""">If I can do it, so can you.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s an incredible message. Gabriel, where can people connect with you if they want to learn more?</strong></p><p id="""">You can find me on Facebook at Sedlak and YouTube at Gabriel Sedlak Official.

We’ll get into all that as well. Miguel, one thing that might help everyone is to give a little bit of your background in your personal journey. You had this story of your own, going from being bedridden to hiking in Hawaii. It is pretty inspiring. It also lays a foundation for why you are qualified to talk about this subject. Could you share that with us, your story, and what led you up to everything you’re doing right now that we can dig into? </strong></p><p>We have to look back even before I had all these symptoms start coming up. What was life like leading up to it? I was a regular kid. I love playing outside. I grew up in Vancouver, B.C., simple family. Growing up, I realized I couldn’t sit still. I was always very driven, almost too driven for my own good. I had this extreme personality. I remember in elementary school, the first time I ever got a C-plus, I felt like a complete failure. I was used to getting those straight A’s. I was that perfectionist.</p><p>I put a lot of pressure on myself growing up to always ‘succeed.’ Fast forward several years. This drive inside led to very fruitful things early on in my life, like wrestling team captain, high school football team captain, and a straight-A honor student. After I graduated, I ended up being one of the top-selling personal trainers in a company with over 300 trainers. I was 22 years old at the time. I had a nice car and was making decent money.</p><p>On the outside, everything seemed like it was on track. Things were moving in the right direction on the surface. It got to the point where my body could not keep up with the demand I was placing on it. I work in 12, 14, and 16-hour days, constantly reading books about personal development, not sleeping right, and not eating right. Most importantly, there was the inner voice of “You’ve got to do more. Be more productive. You’ve got to keep going. Push harder.”</p><p>I equated success with pain, discipline, blood, sweat, and tears. That’s what I told myself in my mind. Eventually, my health started slipping. I fell into a hole that was so deep. I never thought I would get out of it. After a handful of years, with my health slipping, it started with brain fog, insomnia, some anxiety, and random panic attacks. I didn’t even know what anxiety was that whole time. I saw anxiety as a weakness. You’re a sissy. Just push through until you end up in the hospital over and over again, week after week, because you can’t breathe. You feel like your heart’s going to explode. You can’t sleep. </p><p>Things took a downhill turn. After about four years of dealing with that, I was 23 years old. This was when I was at rock bottom. I was lying in that hospital bed all alone, unable to even sit up. I couldn’t feed myself. People beside me were being told they have four months to live, getting out of surgery. I thought to myself, “How did I end up here? Everything was on track. My life was good. I felt like I did all the right things. I’m in so deep a hole. I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to get out.” I’d also been to doctors, specialists, and alternative health specialists over the years. </p><p>About 35 to 40 different specialists and doctors, dozens of emergency room visits, and all of them couldn’t find anything wrong with me. On paper, I was perfectly healthy, but I was feeling all these symptoms. They got my worst. I was completely bedridden, getting spoon-fed for eight months straight. Imagine going from team captain, football team, a top performing personal trainer, and very active. I had a bunch of other side business projects going on. To go from that to not even being able to shower, my grandma had to wipe me down for six months. The other two months I was in the hospital, I had to learn how to use a wheelchair, use a walker, and get back on my own two feet. </p><p><strong>You say something that is an extreme case. A lot of people have had this happen. It’s important to note that you said a couple of things I wanted to point out. That is most people who are success-driven, like entrepreneurs, founders, CEOs, and things like that, the stuff that got them where they want to be is the hard work, the grind, the hustle, and things like that. Although you have to get to a point where some people get to, it is an extreme case. </strong></p><p><strong>Many people are suffering from a lot of those symptoms. It’s hard for them to recognize it because what has gotten them the success, or at least the recognition in their life to this point, is the source of the problem. They don’t see that because they see that as what they’ve needed to be successful. The last thing they want to do is change that. </strong></p><p>It’s exactly what you said. In fact, those personality traits double down on that. When they feel these symptoms, they feel more tired and run down. They almost see that as a challenge of “This is my time to shine. This is where champions are made. I got to push through.” </p><p><strong>As you said, it is a form of weakness, and they don’t want to accept it. They see that as, “I’m going to push even harder, or I’m not going to acknowledge it.” </strong></p><p>These kinds of people, type A personalities, are the last people to reach out for help or show weakness until they have absolutely no choice.</p><blockquote>High achievers with Type A personalities are the last people who reach out for help or show weaknesses until they have absolutely no choice. </blockquote><p><strong>That’s what I was going to say. You actually got the symptoms. You had no choice. We’re going to talk later about how people can catch this early on. Finish your story. What did you do? How did you get some success out of that? </strong></p><p>I feel like I won the lottery when I got paired up with my doctor in the hospital. It’s a wild story. The first month I was in the ICU, they were running every test on me, but all my tests were coming back normal. Clearly, something is wrong. I can’t stop shaking. I have to wear earplugs, construction earmuffs, and blindfolds because I couldn’t even tolerate light. They had to blend my food a lot of times. I had to drink it because my digestive system wasn’t working. </p><p>After they ruled out the fact that my organs were functioning fine, they were like, “This is probably a problem with the way your brain is communicating with your body because on paper, your heart is fine. Your lungs are fine. Everything else is fine, but you say you’re dealing with this stuff. You feel it.” I’m like, “Yes, I’m not making this up.” They were like, “You have an option here. We can either send you home, and you can come back every day to work with these other doctors.” I’m like, “I can’t even sit up, so I can’t do that.” </p><p>The other option was, they said, “We have a bunch of extra rooms in the psych ward. If you want to stay there, that way you can work with a doctor every day.” I was like, “Is this their trick to tell me I’m crazy? Am I going to be locked up in there? Do they think it’s in my head?” They were like, “No, you’d be a volunteer. You get a special wristband. You could go home anytime you want. It’s safe. Don’t worry.” I ended up spending the next month living at a psych ward where I got to work with a psychiatrist every day. </p><p>He’s the one who essentially unlocked what was going on. He was like, “You’re not going to die. You’re feeling all these symptoms, though. You can’t even feed yourself.” This is when I was in a wheelchair. They rolled me into his office. They were like, “Miguel, you pushed your body so freaking hard. Your nervous system has a limit. You clearly exceeded that limit. What you’re dealing with is a hypersensitive nervous system. This is why everything is sensitive.” </p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/6957a4c875cb0f13d0d5507b_Graphics%20-%20Guest%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Miguel%20Bautista.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Understanding What A Hypersensitive Nervous System Feels</h3><p><strong>I read that when I was looking at some information that you had, and learning more about you. So many people suffer from these unexplained symptoms that traditional medicine may or may not be able to define. When you talked about a hypersensitive nervous system or this whole idea behind burnout and chronic stress-related issues, can you explain what you mean when you say hypersensitive nervous system for the audience? </strong></p><p>What it feels like, you feel on edge. You feel a little bit overwhelmed. You feel like your tolerance for stress is much lower than it used to be. Your threshold is much lower. Essentially, what it is, we all have this limit in our nervous system of how much stress we can handle. When I say nervous system, I’m talking about the brain, your survival brain. When you stack up all these stressors, even the pressure you put on yourself, finances, maybe business, relationships, or career, eventually, for a lot of people, it starts to hit the ceiling. At first, you’ll get early warning signs. You’ll start getting anxiety, palpitations, or insomnia. </p><p>Type A personality people will see that as a challenge. I need to double down. They push harder and harder. The further you go above that capacity, your limit, the more symptoms you’re going to feel until your body, your brain, slams on the brake. It says, “We don’t trust you anymore. You’re clearly going to run your body into the ground. We’re going to start forcing you to slow down because we’ve tried to warn you. Now we’re going to force you. Do you want to go work out? We’re going to give you crazy palpitations and shortness of breath when you try that. Do you want to work more on the computer? We’ll give you a ton of brain fog.” These are all signs from the body. People like us interpret them as challenges. It’s common. So many entrepreneurs get this. </p><p><strong>Does it stack up, too? I’m curious. A lot of times, people go throughout their lives. As they get older and they move along, from what I’m reading, it’s not just situational-based. I’ve been in this situation before. Can it build up over time so that similar situations you could have handled before are more difficult for you to handle now because it has built up? </strong></p><p>Absolutely. </p><p><strong>That’s why people say, “I usually can handle this. Now, I can’t.” It’s because it’s built up, correct? </strong></p><p>Yes, absolutely. When your threshold is maxed out, there’s only so much you can handle on your plate before it starts overflowing. It’s like a bucket. Once it slowly starts to reach that point of overflow, that’s when your brain starts to signal your body to stop. It’ll stop you from even thinking. It’ll give you brain fog. I’ve seen it stop people from even being able to look at screens because everything is blurry. They have visual snow, visual issues, hearing issues, memory issues, anxiety, and things like that. Usually, there are 40 or 50 symptoms. </p><blockquote>There is only so much you can handle before your plate starts overflowing. When you reach that point, your brain starts to signal your body to take a break.</blockquote><p><strong>Is the starting point for this retraining your brain, rewiring your brain? It’s not a medical per se condition that you would jump into. Does it begin with the brain? Where does somebody start as they’re seeing these types of symptoms and things? It is your specialty. </strong></p><p>Number one, definitely rule out all other health issues. Go see your doctor. Go get everything checked out. Get the blood work done. Usually, when that’s all completely fine, you’re left there wondering what is going on. People start to develop this health anxiety, almost like hypochondria. You feel like you have some mysterious illness, and you’re going to drop dead. You start to not even trust your own body. You feel your heart rate increase. You start to think, “Am I having a heart attack?” I would start with educating yourself first on what’s even going on. You get out of that downward spiral because it’s like a loop. You feel physical symptoms. </p><p>You’ll get anxious about them because the doctors aren’t telling you what’s going on. The more anxious you are, the more on edge you are, which equals more symptoms. The easiest analogy I can describe this is when we think of a computer, for example. You have the hardware, and then you have the software. We initially think it’s a hardware problem. Maybe it’s the lungs. Maybe it’s my muscles, my legs, or my adrenals. Once you get all of that checked out, once the hardware is okay, now we have to look at it as a software issue. The good news is you can always update the software, but it takes the individual to manually go in there and update that software from a very hypersensitive survival-based brain to a thrival-based brain, a more calm, more regulated brain.</p><h3>How Miguel’s CFS Recovery System Works</h3><p><strong>A lot of people feel like there aren’t a lot of ways to change that, but that’s why I love that concept of neuroplasticity. It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been, how old you are, or what your experience is. You can retrain your brain through conscious frequency, repetition, and that whole concept of neuroplasticity. Also, you’ve developed the CFS Recovery System. Maybe you could walk us through a little bit of what you’ve done because, through the thousands of people you’ve helped and worked with, your own personal story, you’ve created a real system for dealing with and creating recovery. Maybe you could take a minute and walk us through that as well, or some of the phases and pillars of what you do with your clients. </strong></p><p>There is a duplicatable system to go from as severe as bedridden to fully functioning, like running, exercising, traveling, getting your life back, and actually being better than you were prior to getting sick. It starts with education. It’s teaching people what exactly is happening in their bodies. Why are they feeling these symptoms? Why is it not going away? We do that through very short, condensed video modules, coaching calls, and even a nervous system health assessment where we’ll analyze someone’s specific symptoms, how long they’ve been sick, and what stage they are at in terms of severity. </p><p>We’ll match that to a certain approach because the different stages of severity have different approaches. Number one is education. Number two, it’s getting them in the community as well. Once they realize that there are other people dealing with this, it helps them feel a lot better. They sleep better at night because most people we see or who come to us haven’t heard about anybody else who has this. In fact, the doctors don’t even know what chronic fatigue syndrome is. </p><p><strong>Having uncertainty is the worst feeling, whether it’s physical, mental, or emotional, or even in business. That’s got to be a huge help. I see that. </strong></p><p>The community is great. Lastly, it’s the hands-on help where we tell them, “For your specific situation, here are the activities to stay away from. Here are the activities to focus on.” If someone’s a little more severe, if they’re semi-functional, we look at what those triggers are for your nervous system. Some people are still working when they come to us, but they’re deteriorating. They’re not getting better. We need to figure out where those energy leaks are. What are those stressors? The biggest thing is what we talked about earlier. </p><p>There are certain personality traits that people have that amplify these types of issues. Type A personality, perfectionist, over-thinker, over-analyzer, high-achiever. We ought to teach them. We need to teach you to control these things. It’s a double-edged sword. It’s a superpower, but if you don’t learn how to control it, it will control you. You’re not even in the driver’s seat of your own life. This is why you burned out. It’s teaching them to turn the dial down on those certain personality traits, which is very difficult for a lot of people. </p><p><strong>I like what you said there because we’re not necessarily suggesting that the stuff that’s gotten you where you want to be, you give up or you change. You have to learn how to regulate because you don’t want to take your biggest strength that has gotten you to where you want to be and turn it off. That’s what we fear as entrepreneurs, business owners, or whatever, but you can learn to regulate it. </strong></p><p><strong>I like how you said education, but then being aware of it, and then being able to dial it in and turn it out. By default, let’s be honest, most people who have personalities are A-type. I’m one of them. You, almost at a subconscious level, operate that way. You don’t consciously try to, so you do exacerbate any average situation for a lot of people. You've got to learn to recognize that and deal with it.</strong></p><p>If we think about it like a car driving, the cruise control speed is redlining the engine. That’s their baseline cruise control, and something is going to go loose. They don’t meditate, or they don’t take a day off. Even if they take a physical day off, they’re still thinking about work, even if they’re with family. That’s a big one. I had to learn how to disengage from work, even temporarily. It’s teaching them to use those superpowers to their advantage and not against them.</p><blockquote>Learn how to use your superpowers for your advantage and not against yourself.</blockquote><p><strong>What would you say is some of the uniqueness of what you guys do as opposed to traditional treatment models and things like that? What makes your approach to recovery different or unique? </strong></p><p>For a lot of people out there with CFS, long COVID, or fibromyalgia, which are essentially the same thing, the same family of issues, a lot of the resources out there are very education-based. It’s like, “Here’s what’s going on. In general, here’s what you should do. Go apply it.” It’s more general information, whereas with us, we like to get right down there in the trenches with them. We’re there every day, five days a week, messaging them back and forth and making sure things are on track. </p><p>It’s very much like we’ll do it with you versus you doing it yourself. It can get confusing. There’s a lot of information you could follow, but how do you actually implement that? If you go to a gym, it’s like reading all these gym books, but how do you build a program for yourself? How do you know when to do more? What if you get a tiny injury? How much do you pull back? With us, we’re focusing on, especially for the more severe cases, how many times you can go walk downstairs to make your own food each week. How many times can you shower in a week? </p><p>Once we get there, when is it safe to leave the house or start working again? What does that even look like? How do you balance that out with all these other things without crashing? That’s another thing. The people who have this are very sensitive. It doesn’t take much for them to trigger a flare-up. A flare-up means you're out for a few days, a few weeks sometimes even, where you are wiped out. How do we mitigate that while reintegrating into life? </p><p><strong>I’ve seen this over the last 20 to 30 years of working with a lot of businesses, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders. It used to be about the information. Nowadays, you can get the information, education, and what you need to do so easily and quickly. I’ve seen it gravitate towards results that happen from the application of that information. I can see why a lot of times, you can’t see the forest through the trees yourself. It does help having someone to help you do that. </strong></p><h3>Importance Of Taking A Break From The Grind</h3><p><strong>There’s probably a broad spectrum of people who deal with these types of issues and chronic issues. It also extends to plain burnout and long-term fatigue for business owners. Do you have any practical advice or steps that you would give someone? Let’s say they’re back where you were. They’re saying, “Man, I’m noticing these things. Not as big a deal, but they are affecting my life.” What advice, strategies, or even tips would you give them to grab the reins on this type of problem they’re dealing with? </strong></p><p>The biggest advice I could give, and I don’t regret anything, but if I could go back in time, I would tell myself this advice. “Take half a day off every single week. Take half a day off, not just physically. When you're doing the thing, mentally be there. You need some distance from the work or something your mind is so obsessed with. You need that space for it to breathe. Take your foot off the gas pedal 5% of the time, and you’ll be okay.” It’s harder to do that than it is to give the advice. That’s what I would say. </p><p><strong>It’s interesting. I’ve mentioned this a couple of times. We look at ourselves sometimes as corporate athletes. There are professional athletes. They run, drive, grind, and stress their muscles, but they put a lot of effort into recovery. They put time and energy into cold baths, massage, and things like this. It’s in the recovery that we grow. If you’re tuning in to this episode and you’re out there grinding, experiencing some of these things, and haven't learned to prioritize, you’ve got to understand the benefits of recovery because recovery is when the growth happens. I agree with your advice.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong></p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/6957a47e638b2ca8ee5c8c57_Graphics%20-%20Host%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Miguel%20Bautista.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Get In Touch With Miguel</h3><p><strong>Even if you were to just block into your schedule, some of the most important things take some time.

And we are getting ready to drop some massive value for you today. I'm excited because we're here with Rob Kessler, who is, by far, one of the most diversified guys I've talked to in the last little while.</strong></p><p id="""">Rob's an inventor, a businessman with 20 years in sales across multiple industries. He's the inventor of the Million Dollar Collar and now another shirt line, Go Tieless. He's got all kinds of history, which we're going to get into, and I'm really excited to have you here, Rob.</p><p id="""">Thank you. Thanks so much. Good to see you.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it was great because we were able to talk before we got going, and we've just got so many things to cover. One of the things I noticed is that you're just super passionate about what you do, which I think a lot of people feel stuck in where they’re at. They just don’t follow enough of their passions.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Early Entrepreneurial Journey</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So let’s go back a little bit here. Can you give us a little bit of an entry into the entrepreneurial world? Were you like six years old doing lemonade stands, or did you make a transition into entrepreneurship? Tell us a little bit of the backdrop. Let’s take a few minutes on that.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, no, my dad had started a business when I was, I think, two or three years old. By the time I got to be seven or eight, really weird, but he would give me my allowance, which was like five bucks a week, and then lunch money for the week on Sunday night.</p><p id="""">He would do it for me, my brother, and my sister and be like, “Okay, if you want to be an idiot and spend all your money on Monday and Tuesday, you’re gonna starve on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.” So oddly, at 10 or 11 years old, I was getting financial schooling and trying to be responsible with money pretty early.</p><p id="""">So I was fortunate to have my dad do that. At the same time, I was cutting grass and just always had a— I don’t know, I just feel like I got this entrepreneur thing from him. That’s where that started. One of my first jobs in high school was at a little soccer and volleyball store. The guy, on day one, handed me a key to the store, gave me a code to the alarm, and said, “You’re part of the team. This is your business now too.”</p><p id="""">He made me feel, at 17 years old, like I had some ownership in the business. It was cool because I started doing inventory, ordering, a little bit of accounting, and sales. I would go up at night, tear the whole store apart, and remodel and relay everything out. He was like, “Whatever you want to do, man.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow. So you had an owner mentality. Was it because he started that, or did you develop that? There’s not a lot of people out there right now with an owner mentality. Obviously, most of our listeners have that mentality because that’s what they want to pursue. Did you have a job and an owner mentality, or did that situation set you up for it?</strong></p><p id="""">I guess, looking back, I did. I did the lawn cutting, and since I got an allowance from Dad, I only got $5 to cut his lawn, but all the neighbors paid me $10–$15. So I was like, “You’re last.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">No special favors from Dad for sure. Okay.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. At 12 or 13 years old, I was walking with the lawnmower, and I thought, “Somebody’s gonna drive by and see me cutting this grass so well that they’re going to hire me to do their grass.” That’s literally what I thought while pushing the lawnmower at 13 years old.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m gonna put a pin in that for a second because I talk all the time about how it doesn’t matter whether you have a job, a business, or if you’re doing something you don’t believe is your end game—how you do anything is how you do everything. Whether you’re mowing a lawn at 17 or stuck in a job at 40, how you approach anything determines your trajectory. Would you agree that having that owner mentality is what put you on this path?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. I can’t remember who said it, but there’s a quote about providing more service than anyone expects, and you’ll get more back. That always resonated with me long before I ever heard the quote. It was just always putting my best effort out there.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Birth of Million Dollar Collar</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s transition into something because you made a comment, and I actually brought it up earlier. This is a comment, guys, just in full disclosure, that I brought up myself. I always—when I’m not in a t-shirt and hat like today—I’m usually in dress shirts. Lately, I’ve been wearing them untucked, but this idea of the collar has always driven me crazy. I like collar stays, but the lapel on the shirt always wrinkles up. I can starch it all I want, and it still doesn’t look good.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So I ran across Rob, and he created this company, Million Dollar Collar. I want you to talk to us about how that happened. It’s such a cool story. Sometimes the most amazing and obvious ideas are the ones you look at and think, ‘Why didn’t I think of that?’ Tell us about Million Dollar Collar. How did it come about?</strong></p><p id="""">Basically, dress shirts, to me, were always the go-to when I wanted to look good. My now-wife and I, when we were dating, would go out to the bars. She’d look incredible, and I couldn’t go out in a t-shirt, so I’d put on a dress shirt. I hated wearing ties, probably because of my car salesman days when they forced me to wear one.</p><p id="""">I’d unbutton a couple of buttons, but the shirt was always sagging and drooping, especially if I wore a jacket. Fast forward to our wedding—I got married on the beach in Jamaica, totally casual, feet in the sand. My brand-new, freshly pressed shirt was a crumbled mess within 30 minutes. It was starched, ironed, and perfect, but the humid Jamaican air ruined it. All day long, I was yanking at my collar, trying to get the front to sit up. You could see my tank top underneath—it just looked terrible.</p><p id="""">I came home from the wedding, looked at all our photos, and said, “This is a problem.” I searched all over the internet, and everything was some kind of kitschy collar stay. I loved working stiffs, the magnets that bring the collar in, but they didn’t fix the front of the shirt where the buttons and holes are—the placket.</p><p id="""">Dress shirts were designed to be buttoned all the way up and worn with a tie, so they didn’t need structure in the placket. I took the idea of a collar stay, made it nine inches long, and put it down the front of the shirt. That’s Million Dollar Collar. We call it a placket stay—it’s exactly like a collar stay but for the placket. It’s sewn into your shirts.</p><p id="""">You can take all your shirts—I’ve done $700 custom shirts, and I’ve done $11 H&amp;M throwaways. It’s for every dress shirt and collared shirt because there’s no structure in the front. If you like that clean business-casual look, we call it the perfect V. When you don’t wear a tie, a lumpy placket is distracting. It’s one of those fine details you don’t notice until you do, and then you can’t unsee it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let me comment on a couple of things. Guys, success leaves clues. We all face problems in our lives. Rob had a problem, identified a solution, and executed on it. Success leaves clues. The problem here is one we all deal with—looking sharp and professional. How you look and feel affects your energy, attitude, and performance. Rob, you hit it on the head. People judge you on how you look, whether you like it or not.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Your appearance matters, and this product hits a huge need. Also, you’re solving your own problem, which makes it easier to stay passionate. Let’s talk about the process. Did you just throw a prototype together, or was this years of revisions, investments, and hustle?</strong></p><p id="""">From the inception, it was a grind. After our wedding, I started with a piece of cardboard—just to see if a little structure made a difference. I showed it to my wife, and she said, “Oh my God, I finally get what you’ve been complaining about!” But obviously, cardboard wasn’t going to work.</p><p id="""">I started experimenting with flexible cutting boards, mini blinds, milk cartons, zip ties—you name it. Then I’d wash, dry, and iron the shirts, and they’d fail. I ruined at least a hundred shirts trying to figure it out. Eventually, I learned that dry cleaners flash press shirts at 450 degrees. Most high-temperature plastics start to fail at 275 degrees, so I needed something better.</p><p id="""">I worked with a plastics company and developed this proprietary material. It’s super lightweight and flexible but rigid enough to hold up the collar. It’s soft enough to be sewn through, which is key because it’s secured with stitches where the collar band meets the placket. Once it’s in, it lasts the life of the shirt.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Guys, hear that? He didn’t dabble—he went deep. He learned about temperatures, materials, and manufacturing processes. If you’re going to solve a problem, you’ve got to be persistent and committed. Dabbling doesn’t create success. You need to go deep, learn the nuances, and solve the problem fully. That’s inspiring, Rob.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Challenges and Persistence</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, you went deep, but I have to ask: Did you face any major roadblocks while developing Million Dollar Collar? Or was it just smooth sailing?</strong></p><p id="""">It was far from smooth sailing. After developing the material and finalizing the design, I still had to figure out how to make it scalable. I had to think about the costs, the manufacturing process, and whether this would be viable for mass production.</p><p id="""">Even with the product perfected, there was still the challenge of getting it out into the world. I didn’t want to ruin anyone’s shirt, so I didn’t sell a single unit until I knew the material would hold up under all conditions. That meant testing different lengths and shapes. Originally, I wanted the stays to be shorter—because shorter stays would be cheaper to manufacture and ship—but they didn’t work as well. They didn’t give the clean look I wanted. Eventually, we landed on the eight-and-a-half-inch design that overlaps and creates that perfect V.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, it sounds like you spent a lot of time balancing functionality with costs. That’s not something many people think about when they see the final product. They don’t realize the amount of testing and revision that goes into creating something simple yet effective.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Once we had the design, we started pitching it to other brands. We wanted to license the technology to get it into as many shirts as possible. But the response we got from the big brands was always the same: “Sounds interesting, but we don’t know if our customers care about this enough to justify adding it.” So, we decided to sell directly to consumers.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Expansion and Diversification</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">And that’s when you started selling directly. But you didn’t stop there—you’ve since expanded into your own shirt line, Go Tieless. What prompted that move? Was it a natural evolution, or did you feel like you needed to create your own brand to prove the concept?</strong></p><p id="""">It was both. When we started selling Million Dollar Collar directly to consumers, we got a lot of feedback. The biggest challenge was the installation process. People loved the idea but didn’t want to take the extra step of finding a tailor to sew it into their shirts. So, we started offering pre-installed options. I bought wholesale dress shirts—brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger—and installed the stays myself. Then we sold them as finished products.</p><p id="""">That helped solve the problem for some customers, but others kept saying, “Why don’t you just make your own shirts?” After hearing it enough times, we decided to do just that. We launched Go Tieless to create shirts specifically designed for the Million Dollar Collar. These shirts are made from bamboo stretch fabric, so they’re breathable, wrinkle-resistant, and super comfortable. We’ve also added features like convertible cuffs for cufflinks.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, you basically turned customer feedback into a whole new product line. That’s impressive. But how has that shift impacted your business model? Are you still focused on licensing Million Dollar Collar to other brands, or is Go Tieless the primary focus now?</strong></p><p id="""">Million Dollar Collar is still the core of our business. It’s what got us here, and it’s what will keep driving us forward. But Go Tieless is our way of showing other brands what’s possible. It’s a proof of concept. If we can build a successful brand around this technology, it opens the door for licensing deals with other companies.</p><p id="""">Our goal is to have Million Dollar Collar in as many shirts as possible, whether that’s through Go Tieless or partnerships with other brands. We’re already in talks with manufacturers in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, and China, so the licensing side is starting to gain traction.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a smart strategy—using your own brand to prove the value of your technology while still keeping the door open for partnerships.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, with all these moving parts—Million Dollar Collar, Go Tieless, and licensing deals—it sounds like you’ve got a lot on your plate. How do you balance it all and keep moving forward?</strong></p><p id="""">It’s definitely a juggling act. But I’ve always been someone who thrives on progress. Even when things get tough, I just focus on the next step. It’s about setting small, achievable goals and building on them. That’s what keeps me going. And I’ve got an amazing support system—my wife has been my rock through this entire journey. She’s always believed in me, even on the days when I doubted myself.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Lessons Learned and Advice for Entrepreneurs</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You mentioned earlier that you’ve faced some major setbacks, like losing $150,000 in the early years. Looking back, what’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned from those experiences?</strong></p><p id="""">The biggest lesson is to trust your gut but also do your homework. A lot of the money I lost was from trusting people who didn’t deliver on their promises. I hired PR firms, marketing experts, and consultants who said they could take my business to the next level, but they didn’t understand my product or my vision. Now, I’m much more careful about who I work with. I make sure they align with my goals and actually understand what I’m trying to achieve.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such an important point. A lot of entrepreneurs fall into the trap of thinking they need outside experts to succeed, but no one knows your business better than you. Any other advice for entrepreneurs who are just starting out?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes—don’t be afraid to start small. A lot of people think they need everything to be perfect before they launch, but that’s not true. You’ll learn so much just by getting out there and doing it. Also, be prepared for the grind. Success doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time, persistence, and a lot of hard work.</p><p id="""">But most importantly, make sure you’re passionate about what you’re doing. If you’re just in it for the money, you’ll give up when things get tough. Passion is what keeps you going when nothing else will.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts and How to Connect</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Rob, this has been an incredible conversation.

Tell us about your journey to the U.S. and what sparked your passion for personal development.</strong></p><p id="""">Sure. Thank you, George.</p><p id="""">I was born in Nakuru, Kenya, in the Rift Valley region of East Africa. I lived there through my second year of college, and then, in 1999, my father decided to relocate the entire family to the United States.</p><p id="""">We arrived in July of ‘99, right in the middle of summer, and settled in Georgia. This was my first time in the U.S. I had traveled within Africa—to Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa—but I had never been to the West before.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, and adjusting was a challenge. First, there was the heat—it was blazing hot. Then, there was the culture shock. People couldn’t understand what I was saying, and I couldn’t understand what they were saying, even though we were all speaking English.</p><p id="""">Over time, I realized the main issue was that I was speaking too fast. So I learned to slow down my speech, and that helped a lot with communication.</p><p id="""">Once we arrived, we had to figure everything out—where to work, where to shop, how to navigate a new currency. Moving from Kenyan shillings to U.S. dollars was an adjustment in itself. I had to learn what a dime, a nickel, and a penny were.</p><p id="""">One interesting thing I’d like to mention, George, is that when most people migrate from Africa or other countries, the first instinct when shopping is to convert prices into their native currency.</p><p id="""">So I would pick up a loaf of bread, see that it was $2, and mentally convert that to Kenyan shillings. Then I’d think, <em id="""">This is too much</em>, and put it back. It took time for me to accept that I was now in the U.S. and needed to adapt to this currency and cost of living.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, that’s such an interesting perspective.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, and eventually, we settled in. I got my first job working part-time in a grocery store, then later became a telemarketer.</p><p id="""">Believe it or not, I worked for MCI WorldCom, selling long-distance phone service. My pitch would start with, <em id="""">Hey, have you seen the ad with Michael Jordan for MCI WorldCom?</em>—and then people would hang up because I was calling them at dinner time.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Talk about a struggle.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You're literally trying to adjust to a new language, a new culture, and find a job—all while dealing with rejection as a telemarketer. That’s overwhelming. Most people struggle with just the day-to-day, and here you were, completely changing everything about your life.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Journey into Personal Development</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what happened that shifted your focus into personal development? Was there a particular moment that led you toward this career?</strong></p><p id="""">It happened a few years later when I enrolled at Beulah Heights Bible College in Atlanta.</p><p id="""">One of our required courses was on leadership, and our textbook was <em id="""">The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em> by John Maxwell. We went through it over the semester, covering about a chapter a week.</p><p id="""">At the end of the book, there was contact information for John Maxwell’s organization. It said, <em id="""">If you’re interested in coaching or starting a speaking career, email us, and we’ll get back to you.</em></p><p id="""">I let that thought sit for a while. Eventually, in 2016—10 years after graduating from college—I finally took action and enrolled in their coaching certification program.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wow, so it was on your mind for a decade before you made the leap?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes. The thought never left me. I kept watching John Maxwell’s <em id="""">A Minute with Maxwell</em>, a one-minute video clip series on YouTube. Every time I watched, I’d think, <em id="""">Wow, this is really interesting.</em></p><p id="""">He’s so calm and fatherly in his approach. In just one minute, he could communicate so much. And at the end of each video, he had a call to action: <em id="""">If you’re interested in our coaching program, click the link in the description.</em></p><p id="""">So, eventually, I clicked the link.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I’m curious—what made you take action at that moment, 10 years later?</strong></p><p id="""">It was twofold.</p><p id="""">First, I had graduated with a theology degree, but getting a pastoral assignment in the U.S. was difficult. When I approached churches, they’d ask a lot of questions—<em id="""">Where are you from? What do you want to do? How long will you be here?</em></p><p id="""">So I put that dream aside and focused on the motivational speaking route instead.</p><p id="""">I started consuming even more John Maxwell material, signed up for Audible, and listened to tons of audiobooks—not just on Maxwell, but on motivation, mindset, and personal growth. I also listened to Grant Cardone and other speakers in the personal development space.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Was it because the content was helping you personally, or were you drawn to personal development as a career?</strong></p><p id="""">Both.</p><p id="""">And there was one particular law in <em id="""">The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em> that stood out to me—the <strong id="""">Law of Big Mo (Momentum)</strong>.</p><p id="""">Even after finishing the book, I kept revisiting that chapter. I felt stuck—like I wasn’t gaining momentum in life. I had graduated from college but wasn’t getting the opportunities I wanted.</p><p id="""">So I kept circling back to that chapter, trying to understand, <em id="""">What is this Law of Big Mo? Why don’t I have momentum?</em></p><p id="""">That’s when I started diving deep into researching, watching YouTube videos, listening to audiobooks, and actively seeking out ways to create momentum in my life.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s powerful. And it all came full circle when you started writing your book.</strong></p><p id="""">Yes. In 2020, when COVID hit and the world shut down, I wasn’t working for a while.</p><p id="""">One day, I received an email newsletter—it was probably one of those that usually go to junk mail. But this one caught my attention. It said, <em id="""">Do you want to write a book? Click this link.</em></p><p id="""">I clicked the link, and they sent a book template along with a step-by-step guide: <em id="""">Fill out this template, write your introduction, and publish it on Amazon through KDP.</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. You didn’t overthink it—you just took action.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. I gathered quotes that resonated with me, wrote my introduction, and shared my journey on leadership, motivation, and goal setting.</p><p id="""">I'll continue with the next part shortly. Let me know if you'd like any changes so far! </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eventually, I got my book up on Amazon after getting the cover designed on Fiverr. I had to Google everything—<em id="""">Where do I get a book cover? How do I format it?</em> I figured it all out.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s incredible.</strong></p><p id="""">And at first, the book just sat there. But thankfully, friends supported me—they bought copies, and that gave it some traction.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I think people need to hear this: success isn’t about having all the answers—it’s about taking action.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. Taking that first step builds momentum.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Power of Positive Affirmations</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I wanted to ask you in the time we have left, why did you choose the topic of positive affirmations for your book? A lot of people are skeptical of affirmations. They've heard it all the time—<em id="""">I say those things all the time, but it doesn’t help me.</em> Why did you pick that topic? Help me understand a little bit about positive affirmations in your book.</strong></p><p id="""">Thank you.</p><p id="""">It relates to my background and my upbringing. Back home in Kenya, I was the firstborn son. I have two younger brothers and a younger sister, and growing up, I don’t think my parents intentionally meant it, but especially my father—when I didn’t do things right, he’d say things like, <em id="""">I don’t think you’ll amount to anything.</em></p><p id="""">When you hear statements like that, especially as a child, they seep into your subconscious.</p><p id="""">Sure.</p><p id="""">You graduate from high school, but there’s this inner voice that says, <em id="""">You’ll still not achieve what you think you will.</em> It creates a feeling of self-doubt, an inferiority complex.</p><p id="""">And when I had time to sit down, I started reading books. I came across a book by Zig Ziglar that had a collection of quotes, many relating to affirmations and changing your mindset. That’s when I decided to become my own doctor. I diagnosed myself out of negative thinking.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. ""Diagnose yourself out of that negative thinking.""</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. So, I dove into the whole affirmation thing. I did my research and learned about the science behind it. One thing that really intrigued me was <strong id="""">neuroplasticity</strong>—the way affirmations physically change the structure of your brain. I thought, <em id="""">Wow, I can actually change the way my brain works just by speaking positively to myself.</em></p><p id="""">It’s very easy to say, <em id="""">Oh, I’ve gained weight. I’m losing hair,</em> and all the negative self-talk. There’s something about human nature that leans toward negativity. So I had to make a conscious decision to change the trajectory of my life and how I speak to myself.</p><p id="""">I’m a preacher on Sundays, and I tell people how to live their lives and everything. But then come Monday morning, I’m going to work, and I’m like, <em id="""">Oh boy, it’s Monday. I have to deal with my boss.</em> So I realized I had to change this blanket of negativity that fell on me and replace it with positive affirmations.</p><p id="""">That’s when I started researching neuroplasticity and the power of affirmations. I learned that speaking affirmations to yourself, looking in a mirror, or putting sticky notes on the wall and repeating those statements can actually change you and how you live your life.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that, though. You hit a couple of really important things. One is that you decided to diagnose yourself and make a change. That’s cool. I haven’t heard that before.</strong></p><p id="""">The other thing is that affirmations aren’t just some personal development topic. It’s literally a technique that will change your brain. Neuroplasticity is real. If you're struggling with negativity and self-doubt, you’re not just saying something that’s not true. You’re literally programming your mind. And your mind is your best tool—unless it's working against you.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Affirm Your Greatness</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to note for the listeners because you probably forget you’ve done this, but your title really appealed to me. Your title is not just <em id="""">Positive Affirmations</em>—it’s <em id="""">Affirm Your Greatness</em>. I think that speaks to the fact that you’re not just trying to become something great. You’re already something great. You're just trying to have the tools to bring it out. Speak to that for a minute.</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, the title <em id="""">Affirm Your Greatness</em> actually implies that you have greatness in you. It’s just that you have to peel off the layers—like peeling an onion or cabbage—and get to the core of your greatness. You need to get to the core of who you are meant to be, who you were created to be.</p><p id="""">If you’re of a faith persuasion, there’s a saying: <em id="""">God doesn’t make junk</em>.</p><p id="""">So, if God doesn’t make junk, that means you have greatness in you. Regardless of how you were born into this world—whether the circumstances were good or bad—there is a reason you are here. There’s a reason you are alive at this time, and you have a purpose to fulfill.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So it’s up to you to dig deep and find out: why am I here? What am I good at? What legacy do I want to leave behind? What impact do I want to have on this world?</strong></p><p id="""">Even if you don’t become a motivational speaker, I guarantee you have a story inside of you. You just have to dig deep, get rid of the negative self-talk, and find what makes you passionate. What makes your heart sing? What gets you excited in the morning?</p><p id="""">People always say, <em id="""">Thank God it’s Friday</em>, but we should be thankful every day. We should be excited every day, whether it’s Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. We should wake up with zest and enthusiasm for life.</p><p id="""">So, <em id="""">Affirm Your Greatness</em> is a handbook to remind you that greatness is already inside you. You just have to bring it to the forefront.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love it. I love it. And I loved some of the sections of the book. I haven’t finished it yet, but I’m a quick reader, and I loved it because you’ve put the science behind it. You talk about crafting your affirmations, integrating them with your life, overcoming limiting beliefs, and even applying them to health, wellness, and finance. There’s a section for all of that.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Taking Action to Create Momentum</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to note to the listener something really important. And I say this a lot, but success leaves clues. It’s how individuals like you think that is the key. You didn’t just stumble into writing a book or speaking—you made a conscious decision to take action.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You didn’t wait for all the answers to appear magically. You researched, learned, and took action. And I think people need to understand that consuming books, knowledge, and motivation is great—but at some point, you have to make a decision and take action.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. That’s exactly what I realized. You can sit around and read all the books in the world, but if you don’t apply what you learn, nothing changes.</p><p id="""">I think that’s why John Maxwell’s <em id="""">Law of Big Mo (Momentum)</em> stuck with me so much. I kept feeling like my life wasn’t moving forward, but I didn’t realize at the time that <strong id="""">momentum comes from action, not from waiting</strong>.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Exactly. That’s such a huge point. I think so many people get stuck in the cycle of consuming personal development material without actually doing anything. And what I love about your story is that every major turning point came from you taking action.</strong></p><p id="""">Yes! And sometimes that action is just a small step. When I finally clicked on that John Maxwell link after 10 years, it was a small decision—but it changed everything.</p><p id="""">When I clicked on the link to learn how to write a book, I didn’t know what I was doing, but I figured it out. And now, looking back, those little decisions built momentum that brought me here.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Overcoming Self-Doubt and Finding Purpose</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I want to ask you this because I know there are people listening right now who are struggling with self-doubt. Maybe they feel overwhelmed with life and don’t even know where to start. What advice would you give someone who feels stuck? Where should they begin?</strong></p><p id="""">First, I would tell them: <em id="""">Your life has a purpose.</em></p><p id="""">No one arrives in this world by accident. Regardless of the circumstances of your birth, you are here for a reason. Your life has meaning.</p><p id="""">And I know that might sound simple, but the first step in overcoming self-doubt is to remind yourself daily that <em id="""">you matter</em>. Your dreams matter. Your vision matters.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. So, practically speaking, what can they do?</strong></p><p id="""">One thing that really helped me was writing down affirmations. I would write statements like:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><em id="""">I have a purpose.</em></li><li id=""""><em id="""">I am capable of great things.</em></li><li id=""""><em id="""">I am not defined by my past.</em></li></ul><p id="""">If you need a reminder, put them on sticky notes around your house or write them in your phone’s notepad. Read them every day. Say them out loud. Because what you repeat to yourself becomes your reality.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s powerful. And I love what you said earlier about picking a purpose. Because so many people are stuck waiting to “find” their purpose—but the truth is, you can create a purpose.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">If you don’t know what your purpose is yet, pick something. Work on something. Learn something. Pursue something. And along the way, you’ll discover what you were meant to do.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. And taking action toward any goal will open up new doors you didn’t even know existed.</p><p id="""">If I had never taken that leadership course in Bible college, I wouldn’t have read John Maxwell’s book. If I hadn’t clicked on that link years later, I wouldn’t be a certified speaker today. If I hadn’t started researching affirmations, I wouldn’t have written my book.</p><p id="""">Every step leads to the next. But you have to take the first step.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Daily Rituals for Success</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">I ask a lot of my guests this question because I think habits and daily rituals are so important. Do you have a set of daily rituals that you follow? Something that keeps you grounded and moving forward?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes.</p><p id="""">Every morning, before I get out of bed, I pray. That’s how I start my day—by centering myself.</p><p id="""">During the day, I make sure to fill my mind with positivity. Instead of listening to the news or negative talk shows, I listen to <strong id="""">inspirational music, podcasts, or audiobooks</strong>. I rarely consume traditional news because there’s just too much negativity.</p><p id="""">In the evening, I spend time with my wife. We have discussions, read devotionals, and study the Bible together. That’s a key part of my daily routine.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. And that’s a pretty common theme among high achievers—being intentional about what you consume. Because what you feed your mind directly impacts how you feel and perform.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. If all you consume is negativity, you’ll feel negative. If you fill your mind with inspiration and wisdom, you’ll feel empowered. It’s that simple.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Final Thoughts and Where to Connect with Dennis</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Dennis, I’ve really enjoyed this conversation.

Thank you for taking the time to share your insights with us today.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Alicia's Journey - From Engineer to Entrepreneur</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Alicia, let’s start with your story. How does a chemical engineer transition into becoming a successful entrepreneur?</strong></p><p id="""">George, it wasn’t a planned journey, that’s for sure. Like many entrepreneurs, the path evolved organically. My background is in chemical engineering, and my first job was as a process engineer at Monsanto. Many people know Monsanto, and while its reputation is polarizing, I’ll say this: my role as a process engineer taught me to solve problems on a large scale.</p><p id="""">For example, if a batch of Roundup—a herbicide—didn’t meet quality specifications, it was my responsibility to figure out what went wrong in the manufacturing process. That’s where my experience in scaling processes originated.</p><p id="""">Chemical engineers like me focus on taking what chemists create in a lab and designing entire plants or refineries to produce those formulas on a large scale. This analytical and process-driven mindset became the foundation for everything I’ve done since.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s fascinating. And I think many entrepreneurs can relate to your story. Often, they find themselves navigating challenges without a clear process and wish they’d documented what worked along the way.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly, George. Entrepreneurs are incredible at starting things, creating results, and pushing boundaries, but scaling those efforts requires a different approach. My journey from engineer to entrepreneur began when I realized I didn’t want to spend my career in a chemical plant or refinery. I also recognized that I lacked a strong understanding of business—terms like profit, equity, and accounts payable felt like a foreign language to me.</p><p id="""">So, I went back to school at night while working full-time during the day to earn my MBA. After finishing, I moved to Atlanta with high hopes of landing a job that combined my engineering and business skills—maybe even at Coca-Cola! But that didn’t happen.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It’s funny how life throws us curveballs.</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. After two months of job hunting, I decided to create my own opportunity. In 2005, I launched Equilibria as a professional organizing company.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Wait, professional organizing?</strong></p><p id="""">Yes! Think of shows like <em id="""">Hoarders</em> or people like Marie Kondo. My early clients were home-based business owners, not hoarders or chronically disorganized people. They simply needed processes and systems to manage their workspaces. Over time, I leveraged my process engineering background to evolve the business into what it is today: a consulting firm focused on business infrastructure.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Understanding Business Infrastructure</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Alicia, let’s dive into what you’ve built. What exactly is business infrastructure, and how did you pivot toward creating this concept?</strong></p><p id="""">Great question, George. Business infrastructure, as I define it, is simply a system. It’s about linking three core elements in your business:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">People</strong> – Who are the individuals needed to make the business run?</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Processes</strong> – What steps or activities must those individuals follow?</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Tools and Technology</strong> – What resources support those processes and people?</li></ol><p id="""">When these three elements are connected effectively, businesses can operate in a way that is repeatable, sustainable, and profitable.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That makes so much sense, but many entrepreneurs, especially when they’re starting, don’t prioritize this. They’re just trying to get by and throw spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Many entrepreneurs experiment when starting out, which is natural. But as they grow, cracks in their business start to show. Customers complain, quality dips, or deadlines are missed. These are all signs of an overloaded system.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Challenges and Solutions in Scaling a Business</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">So, what are the biggest challenges businesses face that push them toward needing business infrastructure?</strong></p><p id="""">The top challenges I see are:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Too much business to handle</strong> – This is the best kind of problem, but it’s still a problem. If customer complaints increase or deadlines are missed, it’s often because processes aren’t documented or scalable.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Failing audits or compliance checks</strong> – Businesses in heavily regulated industries must meet strict standards. Failing audits due to a lack of structure is a major red flag.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">High employee turnover</strong> – When a team feels overworked or unclear about their roles, turnover spikes. If you’re growing from contractors to employees, you need processes in place to onboard and retain talent.</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such valuable insight. And as you mentioned, many entrepreneurs don’t realize they need systems until they’re drowning in problems.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. Often, business owners are reactive instead of proactive. By the time they realize they need systems, they’re in crisis mode, trying to fix things retroactively.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Foundational Questions for Business Infrastructure</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Alicia, you’ve touched on some challenges businesses face. What are the key questions entrepreneurs should ask themselves to understand if they need business infrastructure?</strong></p><p id="""">I boil it down to four main questions. These are foundational and apply to businesses at every stage:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">What work needs to be done?<br></strong>This involves identifying every task or activity that takes place in your business. Be specific—break it down to a granular level.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">How are those tasks organized into departments?<br></strong>Even if you’re a small business or a solopreneur, think about grouping tasks into functional areas like marketing, operations, or customer service. This creates a blueprint for how work flows.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Do you have an organizational chart?<br></strong>An org chart isn’t just for big companies. It clarifies who is responsible for what, even if the same person wears multiple hats.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">What are the processes for performing the work?<br></strong>Documenting how tasks are completed—step-by-step—ensures consistency. This doesn’t have to be formal. Start simple by recording yourself doing tasks, as I mentioned earlier.</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">These questions seem straightforward, but most people don’t take the time to ask them.</strong></p><p id="""">That’s right, George. They may seem basic, but answering these questions provides clarity. It helps you understand your business at its core and creates a solid foundation for scaling.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Alicia’s Framework for Business Infrastructure</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Let’s talk about your framework. You’ve developed a structured system for implementing business infrastructure. Can you share an overview?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely. The framework I developed has <strong id="""">seven key elements</strong>. Not every business needs all seven, but the first one is essential for everyone. Here’s a high-level breakdown:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Identify What Your Business Looks Like Internally<br></strong>Start with understanding tasks, departments, and roles—those first four foundational questions.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Define Job Descriptions<br></strong>Once you know who ideally should perform each task, create clear job descriptions.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Build an Organizational Chart<br></strong>Map out your team structure so responsibilities are clear.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Organize Digital and Physical Records<br></strong>This includes everything from file storage to ensuring digital tools are easy to navigate.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Document Processes<br></strong>Create step-by-step guides for how work is done.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Optimize Physical Workspaces<br></strong>Even in a digital world, your physical setup should encourage productivity and efficiency.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Streamline Delivery Timelines and Operations Manuals<br></strong>This ensures that as your business scales, everything runs smoothly without constant intervention.</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s a robust system. What I love is how scalable it is—whether you’re a solopreneur or a multimillion-dollar company, this framework applies.</strong></p><p id="""">Exactly. It’s designed to grow with your business.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Practical Tools and Tips for Entrepreneurs</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Alicia, your framework is powerful, but let’s get tactical. What are some tools or tips entrepreneurs can start using right away to improve their business infrastructure?</strong></p><p id="""">Absolutely! Here are some practical steps and tools to get started:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Document Your Processes</strong> <br><ul id=""""><li id="""">Use your <strong id="""">phone</strong> to record yourself performing tasks. Most smartphones have built-in audio or video recording features.</li><li id="""">Tools like <strong id="""">Zoom</strong> or <strong id="""">Loom</strong> are great for screen recording, especially when demonstrating software workflows.</li><li id="""">Upload these recordings to a private <strong id="""">YouTube channel</strong> or tools like <strong id="""">Dropbox</strong> or <strong id="""">Google Drive</strong> for easy sharing and storage.</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Centralize Team Communication</strong> <br><ul id=""""><li id="""">Platforms like <strong id="""">Slack</strong> allow you to create channels for different projects or teams, making communication organized and efficient.</li><li id="""">Slack integrates seamlessly with tools like <strong id="""">Zoom</strong> and <strong id="""">Google Workspace</strong>, which simplifies collaboration.</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Organize Digital and Physical Records</strong> <br><ul id=""""><li id="""">Tools like <strong id="""">Notion</strong> can serve as your central hub for documenting processes, organizing files, and sharing resources. It’s a game-changer for keeping everything in one place.</li><li id="""">Use cloud-based storage like <strong id="""">Google Drive</strong> or <strong id="""">OneDrive</strong> to ensure documents are accessible to your entire team.</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Leverage Video Tutorials</strong> <br><ul id=""""><li id="""">Create video walkthroughs for onboarding new team members. This is especially useful if you’re working with remote assistants or contractors in different locations.</li><li id="""">These videos can be easily updated as your processes evolve.</li></ul></li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s gold. I love how simple and actionable these suggestions are.</strong></p><p id="""">The key is to start small. Even recording a quick video or organizing one folder can make a big difference over time.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Taking Action</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What would you say to entrepreneurs who feel overwhelmed by the idea of creating systems?</strong></p><p id="""">I’d say, just start. It doesn’t have to be perfect. The biggest hurdle is taking that first step. Remember, systems are meant to evolve. What you create today can always be refined later.</p><p id="""">Also, think of it this way: documenting your processes is like reviewing game footage in sports. Professional athletes watch themselves play to spot areas for improvement. It’s the same with your business. If you don’t capture what’s happening, how will you know what’s working or where things are breaking down?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s such a great analogy. And for anyone listening, I encourage you to replay this section and take notes. These tools and strategies can truly transform how your business operates.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion and Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Alicia, this has been such a valuable conversation. Before we wrap up, what final advice would you give to entrepreneurs who are listening and ready to take action?</strong></p><p id="""">My advice is simple: start small, but start now.</p><p id="""">You don’t have to overhaul your entire business in one day. Begin by asking the four key questions we discussed:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">What work needs to be done?</li><li id="""">How are those tasks organized into departments?</li><li id="""">Do you have an organizational chart?</li><li id="""">What are the processes for performing the work?</li></ol><p id="""">Even answering one of these questions can bring clarity and help you identify the next steps. And don’t be afraid to experiment—your systems will evolve as your business grows.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">How to Connect with Alicia</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">For those ready to dive deeper into business infrastructure, where’s the best place to find you?</strong></p><p id="""">My personal website,<a href=""https://aliciabutlerpierre.com"" id=""""> aliciabutlerpierre.com</a>, is the best starting point.

He's studied over 170 books, attended a ton of seminars, and really mastered the science of success. So we're gonna get into his story a bit and some of the things that he feels help his clients.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Florian Roque's Background and Journey</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">But Florian, maybe what you could do for us is, for those that don't know you, give us a little bit of your backdrop before we get into a whole bunch of the rest.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Where did you come from? What was your journey? What sort of brought you into this realm of what you do today? Give us a little bit of your background and journey.</strong></p><p id="""">Yes, absolutely. Thank you, George. The backstory has evolved over the last 11 years now. The first seven years were fairly humbling—and fairly humble, I have to say.</p><p id="""">I had the good fortune of starting personal development very early. I left school when I was 18, graduated with very good grades. So there was a promising future for me—at least from the academic path of how you think about life. When you finish school and get good grades, everything's open. But they don't necessarily teach you about real life skills and the skills of personal development and skill acquisition, do they?</p><p id="""">And so I didn't quite know what I wanted to do. I went to Australia—purposefully as far away from Germany, where I was born and raised, as I could go—and started to gather some life experience. I was selling door-to-door fresh produce, strawberries, as a very humbling first experience.</p><p id="""">Higher-volume sales. I realized that a lot of people who do well later in life in business tend to have a background in sales. It's either cold calling or door-to-door. So it was very beneficial. It teaches you a whole lot about yourself and about people. And yeah, strawberries are a great product to get your foot in the door.</p><p id="""">Anyway, that was my humble beginning. Then I came back to Germany and realized that I really needed to clean up my life. I still didn’t have a girlfriend back then. I was smoking, drinking a lot of alcohol—really going down a bad path.</p><p id="""">Apart from doing well in school, I didn’t do well in life. Yes, I knew how to relate to people, but there were a lot of things I needed to clean up. And it was a wake-up moment when I came back at 20 years old, being in my old room, looking around, and realizing I hadn’t really progressed at all in those two years I was away.</p><p id="""">So I stumbled across—actually, I opened a drawer in my old desk—and there was a manual from a persuasive oratory course I took back in middle school. That led me to a video by a body language teacher, which eventually led me to a video by Jim Rohn called “Jim Rohn Skills” or “Live a Mediocre Life” from 1984 in Anaheim, California.</p><p id="""">It was so impressive to me that I listened to that audio probably 60 to 80 times in my car. I didn’t know there were other audio programs. That was the first thing I found. And the message of it—it sounds so simple—but the message was: if you want to change your life, you can. You can change your life by action.</p><p id="""">It wasn’t part of my mindset growing up in Germany, in the GDR. There was a lot of Soviet rule, and my parents and grandparents—well, it was ingrained in them through the school system and how they were brought up. That message from Jim Rohn changed my life.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Discovering Personal Development</h3><p id="""">So I bought a pair of dumbbells and a crate of used books from Amazon because Jim Rohn said, “The book you don’t read won’t help.” You gotta read. That’s exactly how I got started. I read everything from the intersection between philosophy and psychology—all the old classics from psychotherapy and even psychoanalysis—Freud in the original.</p><p id="""">And I didn’t really know what I was looking for. I didn’t even know what... I just knew I had to read, lift some weights, and just try to clean up my life. So this is where I started. I enrolled myself in business psychology, went to college for a year, and realized it was way too slow. I wanted it more pure.</p><p id="""">So I started my own business instead. I served the industrial paint manufacturing industry in Germany because that was a business my father worked in. So I knew a little bit about it and thought, yeah, I’m so good at marketing, I’m going to apply that here. It did work, but I also realized it wasn’t quite my true passion.</p><p id="""">And then I went deeper into personal development. Got some publications eventually.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah, it's interesting. It's interesting you say that because a lot of people don't know what they're looking for—but they know that there's something more. And then some piece of information, whether it's an audio, a video, a person... and Jim Rohn, he's a master. He is definitely one of the fathers of personal development.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Deep Dive into Personal Development</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Jim Rohn gave you this opportunity to change your life. And even then though, it sounds like you didn't really know what you wanted to do—you just decided, “I'm gonna go get some dumbbells, I'm gonna start working out, I'm gonna start doing things.” And so you proceeded.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I mentioned as you got going here—170 books, tons of seminars. What gave you this voracious, if that's how you say it, appetite for personal development? Because there's a lot of people I know that are like, “I heard that message and that changed my life,” but you seemed to really go heavy into personal development and mindset. Why do you think that was?</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah, a couple of reasons.</p><p id="""">First of all, you see there in the back wall—two of those certificates are from Tony Robbins’ company. Jim Rohn was Tony Robbins’ original teacher. And Tony always says, when he works in seminars with people and they don’t know what they want, oftentimes he starts with: “Where do you want to go?”</p><p id="""">What do you want? And if they don’t know, then he goes, “What don’t you want? What do you want not anymore in your life?” And so that was it for me. I just knew that the way I was living—I did not want. I was looking down at myself: I was fairly skinny, not very strong, didn’t really like that I couldn’t relate to women, even though I wanted very much to.</p><p id="""">But I just didn’t have the skill. Although I had this verbal capacity, since I was two or three years old people have been telling me, “Man, if you don’t become a teacher of some kind, then you’ve got to do something with your voice.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I knew your voice is way better than mine. I was like, oh my gosh, this guy’s got like a voice for oratory and speaking.</strong></p><p id="""">Thousands of hours of practice. That didn’t come naturally. I can send you some videos from five years ago—there was this very high-pitched voice, very forced, very pleasing. That’s all practice. That’s part of my message too: we gotta put in the hours and practice. Life changes through action—through behaviors.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And you uploaded this great video yesterday—we went through the last two of your 10... I forgot what you were calling it—but micro habits was one of them, neuroplasticity, and then the visualization and strategic micro habits that compound.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But I also like what you said—and I want to make sure I really emphasize that for our listeners—you don't have to know what you want. But you do need to just start taking action, because along the way you're gonna create what you want.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But it is interesting that you say—and I haven’t heard this a lot, so I like that you said it—if you don't know what you want, you can really identify what you don't want. Most people do know what they don't want. And that’s what you did. And as a result, you just started taking action to move away from that. Which is amazing.</strong></p><p id="""">Certainly. And that’s all credit to Tony Robbins because usually what you want is very close to the inverse of what you don’t want—if you play it out.</p><p id="""">There are lots of psychological reasons why people can’t come up with what they want. That can be perfectionism, that can be not wanting to make a mistake, many different things. But if you ask them what they <em id="""">don’t</em> want, they’re usually more clear on that. And then you, as a coach or facilitator, can inverse that and feed that back to them so that they say, “Yeah, that’s actually what I want.”</p><p id="""">So if I looked down at myself and said, “I'm skinny, I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't know what to do with my life,” then probably the inverse of that is: “I would love to have a loving relationship, be a little bit more physically capable, and have a direction in life.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That is such a great point. You think about it—people do know what they don't want, and it usually is the inverse of that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why do you think people don't recognize that? Is it that they are almost sometimes afraid of what they do know they want—but they don't think they can get it? Because you're right—it’s very intuitive. If you know what you don't want, you most likely know what you want.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why do you think that is? You've worked with a lot of individuals... maybe sometimes it just takes going that roundabout way. So let me ask you this:</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Identifying and Overcoming Patterns</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What took you from your passion of personal development and all the knowledge that you were doing into the actual field of working with people—coaching and consulting high-net-worth business owners and things like that? Was there a moment, a pivot moment? Or did you just evolve into that business?</strong></p><p id="""">So what I was telling in the story, those were basically the first two or three years. There are many more years until this point we’re talking about. But when I was in college—after the second semester—I was always listening to this business podcast, right? And one of the speakers there, by the name of Maxim Kovich (in Germany, still), was giving personal development seminars.</p><p id="""">And his take on that was that he was distilling the best practices of past and present geniuses—Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, and even modern people we consider outstanding in their field. He was breaking that down into their habits, mindsets, and daily actions—and teaching that in a seminar.</p><p id="""">So I was listening to that podcast and realized, I just needed to meet this person. Because that same bookish pursuit of knowledge was very appealing to me.</p><p id="""">So I went there. And the first time I set foot in that seminar—it sounds like I made up this story—but it was just like an inner knowing: “This is what I want to do in my life.”</p><p id="""">It was like I looked around and thought, “If I can make money doing that—public speaking, being on stage, and transferring knowledge of some kind—that’s what I want to do.”</p><p id="""">So that was clear for me. But still, my life wasn’t quite working out the way I thought it should. And so this is where the journey of the actual work started—where I had to look at the topics within.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">The Impact of Generational Trauma</h3><p id="""">Part of my upbringing that I haven’t talked about yet is that I had very loving parents. They put a lot of emphasis on education and experiences. We visited a lot of holiday parks and science museums. They really took care of our education—my brother and I.</p><p id="""">But they were also quite confused. From my mother’s side, all three children of my grandparents—my mother, her sister, and her brother—all ended up in tragedy. My mother and her sister committed suicide. My uncle worked himself into the ground. One day, he just passed out—and that was it. He just worked himself into the ground.</p><p id="""">And I asked myself, “Why is that?”</p><p id="""">We have these invisible things that seem to be affecting us so much. And especially because I was running the same patterns. A lot of people here in the audience—and you probably as well—have realized from reading books on psychotherapy and psychology that oftentimes people do end up living out the same patterns as their parents, even though they don’t want to.</p><p id="""">For example, someone was physically abused as a child—as horribly as that is—and then usually that person says, “I will never do this. I will never be like my father who did this.” But then at some point, they realize: “Man, I’m just like my father in these moments when the anger comes out.”</p><p id="""">And a lot of people have that, right?</p><p id="""">Or: “I will never cheat. I will never be cheated on.” These types of patterns are so ingrained in us.</p><p id="""">And I realized I was living out the same kind of depressed, manic-depression cycles, even though I tried so hard not to. That really led me to the work with psychedelics, with ayahuasca, with hypnotherapy—all kinds of tools in order to really pinpoint the psychological forces inside of us that make us live out these patterns.</p><p id="""">And that’s what I believe is one of the unique things I want to bring to the world of personal development—that I’m able to articulate that for people. So if somebody comes to me and they struggle with something they can’t explain—a habit they don’t want to do or something they feel they <em id="""">should</em> be doing but can’t—I’ve gained the capacity to articulate that and help them with it.</p><p id="""">Because here’s the thing: once people can identify it and have language for the pattern, they are no longer identified with it.</p><p id="""">So if you can’t even abstract from it, can’t explain it or give a name to it—you are identified with it. You’re in it. You’re living it out.</p><p id="""">But once you have the capacity to identify it, it breaks the identification with the pattern.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. I think most people are in the movie. You know what it’s like—we’re watching a movie and the lights are out, and you're so into it that you're scared, you're fearful, you're rooting for the hero... but you're in the movie.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I love that analogy because I think you’re right. Until you become the conscious observer of not just your life but your thoughts and everything... I think you are absolutely right.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And it's interesting 'cause you've had such a hard journey. A lot of times, people would be overwhelmed and it would take them down. But you were able to notice that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I think you do have that gift for the two things you said—I kinda like to say the awareness and the articulation. You really do have that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Because a lot of people—without a coach or mentor—they don’t even have the ability to <em id="""">see</em> their patterns. You have the awareness and identification, but then the ability to articulate that.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I’ve noticed—you really do emphasize, and you mentioned it a minute ago—habits and mannerisms. To be successful, you talk about how important that is.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Could you give us some ideas of how people can start identifying their patterns and begin to shift them? Because that’s the hard part—changing. Do you have suggestions on ways people can start to shift their mannerisms and their habits?</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">The Power of Friendships and Coaching</h3><p id="""">Yeah, definitely. Let’s unpack that.</p><p id="""">That’s a two-sided answer. First of all: how do people identify that?</p><p id="""">I do believe in the power of talking to people. Yes, I believe it is beneficial to hire a coach—but this is not meant to be a sales pitch. Even if you don’t hire a coach, talk to friends. People don’t do that enough.</p><p id="""">Another thing we can go into is the framework I help facilitate for people to do better in their life. One of those four factors is friends—including a spouse. Most people realize that having a supportive spouse is beneficial. But a lot of people do not see the value of friends—people you can talk to on a weekly basis, as a habit.</p><p id="""">Consult with others. Get their feedback.</p><p id="""">That’s how you get perception and awareness on your patterns.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You actually make a point—and I don’t mean to interrupt you—you make a great point. Most people just see friendship as “oh, that’s the fun stuff.” But what you're saying is, there’s a real tangible, specific result in your life—helping you to identify things—through friendships. That’s a great point.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. And tying it back to your previous question—about how long I’ve been doing this and coaching people—I’ve been talking to people for a lot of years. Even during the years I was still struggling myself, I had a few people from back in the day—very select few.</p><p id="""">A lot of people I had to let go of in my life. But a few people—though not financially successful—had one area or strength that we could help each other with. We would have weekly accountability calls. We’d connect because I could point something out in him, and he had the maturity, the awareness, and the willingness to hear me—and vice versa.</p><p id="""">So I’m really a proponent of making things easy and practical.</p><p id="""">If you don’t want to hire a coach, talk to friends—and be willing to be told the things you don’t want to see.</p><p id="""">That’s how people gain awareness.</p><p id="""">And now the second piece to your question—how do you actually shift?</p><p id="""">Yeah. Unfortunately, that does depend on the person. It depends on how the person receives reinforcement best.</p><p id="""">For some people, it’s easier to do things together—with friends. That’s one way.</p><p id="""">Other people like to utilize technology—apps, calendar reminders, scheduled check-ins. That’s another way you can form better habits.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">The Role of Visualization and Motivation</h3><p id="""">Another way is to get really clear on your <em id="""">why</em>.</p><p id="""">Some people get motivated by realizing their past failure to act has brought them to their current, unwanted place. And by reemphasizing that pain—and visualizing it—that drives them forward.</p><p id="""">For other people, it’s the future outlook.</p><p id="""">And now we can go deeper into Tony Robbins’ psychology of human needs. I know you’ve talked about that on your channel. In the meta-programs, some people are <em id="""">towards</em> motivated. Some are <em id="""">away from</em>.</p><p id="""">I have a client who really responds when he looks back and says, “Okay, I’m not doing this. And the reason I’m here, where I don’t want to be, is because I failed to do XYZ in the past.” That’s what clicks for him.</p><p id="""">For someone else, it’s like, “Let’s get clear on the future vision.” Once they put an image in front of them—a vision board—that’s what activates their momentum.</p><p id="""">I'm sure in another 20 or 30 years, I’ll have a more precise answer. But right now…</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">No, that depends on the person.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I'm telling you, Florian, that’s beautiful how you say that. Because I think you're breaking it down for people to realize—you’ve gotta be aware of it, you've gotta identify it.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Obviously you're great at helping to articulate that. But you said something that a lot of people don’t say in the personal development space.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">They give you all these lists. Personal development becomes, “Okay, I’m gonna meditate, journal, gratitude, vision board, take action…” But what you said was—do something that works for you.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Exactly. Personalizing habits that work for you. And if you don’t, a lot of times—obviously with a coach or a mentor—they can help you identify what’s really getting you results.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">But I think that’s beautiful, man. I think that’s really what creates the result: personalizing your approach. Because you can beat your head against the wall all day long with affirmations or vision boards—and if that’s not what gets you going, where do you go? So I love that you said that. That’s huge.</strong></p><p id="""">Yeah. For some people, it really is the circle of friends they surround themselves with.</p><p id="""">For me, I’m a very visual person. The background on my phone, the background on my laptop—it’s a motivational image. I don’t look at the default Windows background. It’s not helpful for me.</p><p id="""">Because the things you behold <em id="""">habitually</em>—they do something to you.</p><p id="""">Auditory, too. I’ve made myself my own affirmations and incantations—literally went through hundreds of sentences that were meaningful to me—and narrowed it down to 25–50 of the most impactful ones.</p><p id="""">And then I listened to them—over and over—in the shower, in the car. For example:</p><p id="""">“All of the answers and resources are inside of me and within reach.”</p><p id="""">That’s very impactful and important to me. Because it carries over to the people I work with.</p><p id="""">Like, a tiny example—I was working with a client, and I noticed he had really good handwriting. He was trying to break out of his job. And I told him, “Do you realize that those handwritten posts on LinkedIn do <em id="""">incredibly</em> well? That could literally be your <em id="""">habit to freedom</em>.”</p><p id="""">Your handwriting is a true <em id="""">resource</em>.</p><p id="""">And so, by me repeating that and reinforcing that awareness within myself—of making the most of my resources—that carries over to my clients too.</p><p id="""">It’s very interesting how that works—when you really <em id="""">believe</em> a thought.</p><p id="""">We could geek out on that all day, but this is...</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And it is also interesting to me how sometimes the most successful people—because personal development isn’t just for people who aren't succeeding.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Some of your clients—and some people I’ve worked with over the years—some of the most successful people struggle with self-doubt, with lack of clarity, with lack of focus.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Which leads me to one of the questions I was going to ask you.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Focus and Clarity in Business</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">One of the core things I believe—and I think you've articulated this—that you do, and your purpose for helping individuals like AI SaaS founders, B2B AI owners, family office executives, and generational wealth families, is to create <em id="""">focus</em> and <em id="""">clarity</em>.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Could you speak to what you do and how you approach creating focus and clarity? What does that really mean in business?</strong></p><p id="""">Focus, first of all, means: What do you <em id="""">focus</em> on in your business?</p><p id="""">There are many things you <em id="""">can</em> do—but there are <em id="""">right</em> things to do at the <em id="""">right time</em>, aligned with your strategy. That’s where focus comes in.</p><p id="""">Are we working on implementing a sales process this quarter? Are we incorporating a new social media channel? Or do we say “no” to a new channel and just do three times more of what’s already working?</p><p id="""">In investing—families ask themselves: “AI is a great opportunity, blockchain, Web3... but we know commercial real estate. Should we go into those?”</p><p id="""">And if not—can we leverage those new opportunities to enhance our <em id="""">existing</em> investment strategy, rather than pivoting into something entirely new?</p><p id="""">So focus means: where do we move our <em id="""">collective thought energy</em>? What direction do we give our team? Because if we’re good leaders, the team will follow that direction.</p><p id="""">The process is very individual. What I usually do is help people figure out what’s <em id="""">really</em> important to them, and what their decision-making criteria are.</p><p id="""">So if we’re trying to decide something, there’s a reason for choosing yes or no. I help them play that out. That’s where my conversations go deep.</p><p id="""">We’ll pick <em id="""">one outcome</em> we want to get done—ideally in that call—and spend 45 minutes going deep on that one thing. Because getting <em id="""">that</em> right makes everything else easier.</p><p id="""">We play it out.</p><p id="""">“Why would you do that?”, “What’s the risk?”, “What’s the doubt?”, “Oh, it’s about this team member? Okay, but you’ve also committed to this, and you have <em id="""">these</em> resources.”</p><p id="""">We walk through it.</p><p id="""">That process becomes more of an <em id="""">intuitive art</em>, similar to how Tony Robbins has his “seven master steps of lasting change.” But what he does is still quite intuitive.</p><p id="""">Same here. I use past experience, pattern recognition, and intuition to walk people through to clarity.</p><p id="""">Because often, people think they <em id="""">should</em> be making decisions based on a certain criteria. But when we dig in, that criteria isn’t aligned with what <em id="""">they</em> would truly decide—if no one else’s influence was present.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Inner Work and External Success</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yeah. And life and business are so complicated.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I was doing a podcast the other day—I’m a cohost on the Franklin Planner Podcast—and we were talking about digital overwhelm.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It reminded me, as I was planning our discussion, about how you did a lot of deep work in Peru—and how it shaped your coaching style because of stillness. It’s the opposite of digital overwhelm, right?</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You had said that time in Peru really influenced your ability to get grounded. Can you speak to that? Because a lot of people have trouble blocking out the noise—which I think is critical to creating focus.</strong></p><p id="""">100%. And this always reflects your inner state.</p><p id="""">When I speak to AI SaaS and app founders, they often struggle to <em id="""">commit</em> to one thing. They have different businesses, different partners, and different opportunities.</p><p id="""">Just like it’s hard for some people to commit to one <em id="""">spouse</em>, it’s hard to commit to <em id="""">one</em> business model.</p><p id="""">There are two main reasons I’ve identified:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">What if it doesn’t work?</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">What if I did <em id="""">everything right</em>, and it <em id="""">still</em> doesn’t work?</strong></li></ol><p id="""">That second one is deeper. It’s like... if I fully commit, and I do <em id="""">all the right things</em>, and it <em id="""">still</em> fails—what does that say about me?</p><p id="""">That’s why it’s important to <em id="""">articulate</em> these thoughts. Once you speak it out, it's not as scary anymore.</p><p id="""">We’ll say, “I don’t know if I can share this part of myself... What if people leave me? What if my spouse never talks to me again? What if my business partner quits and leaves me in debt?”</p><p id="""">We <em id="""">want</em> to confront that. We want to speak that through.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Healing the Inside to Fix the Outside</h3><p id="""">Once we clean up <em id="""">inside</em> ourselves—things start to clean up on the <em id="""">outside</em>.</p><p id="""">It’s like a mirror principle.</p><p id="""">When we know who we are, what our strengths are, what we feel aligned with—then our surroundings align too.</p><p id="""">Some people chase things externally because they’re disordered inside. Like me, when I was younger—I chased different women out of a need for significance and validation.</p><p id="""">I look back now and say, “That was a huge mistake.” But it was a reflection of my own disorder.</p><p id="""">If you don’t have a grounded sense of self, you’ll be drawn to every new opportunity. You won’t commit. You’ll switch paths constantly.</p><p id="""">That’s why inner spiritual transformation has real, tangible effects. People say, “What’s the benefit of this healing work? Why would I go to therapy or drink ayahuasca or sit in silence or do breathwork?”</p><p id="""">The benefit is that your <em id="""">external</em> life changes—because your <em id="""">internal resonance</em> changes.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Very interesting.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And yeah, I’ve worked with that a lot. Some listeners may not resonate with that, and sure—I might lose a bit of respect from a few people. But I don’t care. It’s part of my truth. It’s part of my brand.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Correct. And that’s the thing. You can only speak your truth.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I think people are becoming more aware of this.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Personal Development 1.0 is: “What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.” — Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Personal Development 2.0 is: Your <em id="""">inner world</em> creates your <em id="""">outer world</em>.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And that outer world is <em id="""">not</em> where you get your validation or success—if your <em id="""">inner world</em> isn’t grounded, stable, and focused.</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Mindset as a Form of Action</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">You said something recently that caught me off guard—but made a lot of sense.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You said: “Mindset is a form of action.”</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Most people don’t think of mindset as action. Can you explain what you mean by that?</strong></p><p id="""">100%. Thank you for bringing that up.</p><p id="""">You’re asking amazing questions. That’s why we vibe so well—because you really get the nuance behind this.</p><p id="""">Yes, personal development needs innovation. It needs to be more <em id="""">action-focused</em>. We all know—life changes through action.</p><p id="""">But there are invisible forces that <em id="""">affect</em> our ability to take action. If it were easy, everyone would do it.</p><p id="""">Motivational Instagram pages will tell you exactly what to do: “Take a cold shower,” “Get up early,” “Work out,” “Surround yourself with winners.”</p><p id="""">But <em id="""">why don’t we do it</em>?</p><p id="""">Mindset is action because it's <em id="""">habitual</em>.</p><p id="""">When a sensation is evaluated, it becomes a <em id="""">perception</em>. And your <em id="""">perception</em> forms how you act.</p><p id="""">If I’m in Peru and the power goes out, I train myself to think, “Ah, an opportunity to reconnect with George.” Not: “I hate myself. I’m a failure.” That mindset <em id="""">is</em> action. It changes how I respond.</p><p id="""">It’s also about your mental <em id="""">filters</em>.</p><p id="""">Are you wired to judge people out of your own insecurity? Or are you looking for ways to elevate others?</p><p id="""">That’s what I mean by mindset as action. It’s a series of habitual, evaluative actions that define your life.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I love that. One of my early mentors, Robert Berg, who helped Tony Robbins and Deepak Chopra build their programs—he used to call it your ‘philosophy.’</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">He said it’s not just beliefs—it’s your thought pattern. It’s a <em id="""">decision</em>. Life happens <em id="""">for</em> you or <em id="""">to</em> you.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And if you decide that, it becomes your philosophy. That lens affects everything you do.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And I love how you put it—mindset is action because it’s a decision.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And you <em id="""">do</em> decide your philosophy.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Sure, you’ve been influenced by beliefs and people—but you can choose whether to accept those ideas or not. Wouldn’t you agree?</strong></p><p id="""">100%. I love it. I love it.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Final Thoughts and Connecting with Florian</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Man, I wish we had more time. We’re out of time—but before we go, where’s the best place for people to connect with you?</strong></p><p id="""">LinkedIn, definitely.</p><p id="""">A book is in the works, but it’s still in progress. So I won’t promise that yet.</p><p id="""">For now—connect with me and shoot me a message on LinkedIn. Whether you're a family office CIO or just someone looking for guidance, I respond to people and give them what they need.</p><p id="""">So hit me up there.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Great. And if you're listening to the show, I’ll put Florian’s info in the show notes. I highly recommend you start the conversation.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve learned a lot today: finding your path, taking action, doing the inner work. All of that is critical.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So connect with Florian. And before we wrap—Florian, any last thoughts you want to leave the listeners with?</strong></p><p id="""">What you behold is what you become.</p><p id="""">Be very careful what you let into your mind. Jim Rohn said your mind is a garden—you’ve got to pull out weeds constantly. Maintain it like a piece of real estate.</p><p id="""">Sometimes things get rusty—you’ve got to maintain your thoughts.</p><p id="""">Ask yourself—do you <em id="""">really</em> need all that stimulation and information? What kind of foreign thoughts are being planted in your mind that may not even be your own?</p><p id="""">Many people already have <em id="""">enough</em> information. They need to listen to their <em id="""">own</em> thoughts—the positive ones—and <em id="""">act</em>.</p><p id="""">Then come back and listen to more.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s great advice. And it aligns perfectly with why I wanted you on the show.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I believe we all have greatness inside of us. You likely don’t need anything <em id="""">outside</em> of you to live the life you were meant to live. But you <em id="""">do</em> need to do the work.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Creating clarity, doing the work, identifying your thoughts—like Florian said—is the way. Let’s be honest, life is already hard. Doing this work might seem hard, but it’s not as hard as life when you avoid it.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So if this is your first time listening, make sure you follow us.

However, it offers more medical benefits than you could imagine. George Wright III pulls back the curtain on the science behind it with licensed massage therapist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drdominiquemcarson/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Dominique Carson</a>.

That’s for blessed hands, is that what that means?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/69734f0d337c5baf63d93c9f_Graphics%20-%20EB%20-%20AIP%20Dr.%20Dominique%20Carson.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Dominique Carson | Massage Therapy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Dr. Dominique’s Work As A Licensed Massage Therapist </h3><p><strong>I love that. That’s a mobile massage therapy business, but what’s crazy and awesome about you is that you take a holistic approach. You believe it’s not just about stress relief and reduction. You really believe that overall health, mind and body is important. Tell me what that means to you. By the way, thank you so much for being here but tell me what you’re all about. Tell me a little bit about why you chose that name for your business, even.</strong></p><p>I’m an Italian speaker, so first and foremost. I’ve been studying Italian since I was fourteen in high school and it was on my wrist. My partner, my significant other, we were going over names and he was like, ‘How about you name it what’s on your arm?” I was looking at it and I said, “Mani Benedette. I help people impact with my hands,” and then I think about my work in my career as a journalist and that’s how the name came about. I wanted a very unisex name that can attract male and female. I was like, “Maybe I should write it out, blessed hands in English.” I was talking to my aunt who is an entrepreneur and cosmetology and she was like, “No, I think it needs to stay the Italian name. The name is interesting.”</p><p><strong>You’re doing what you love. Most people would hear that and think, “Those are two completely different industries,” massage therapy, your business as well as being a freelance journalist but you really do heal people with both your hands and your words. Wouldn’t you agree?</strong></p><p>Yes, absolutely.</p><p><strong>Tell me a little bit about what you believe. Why did you get into massage and why is it more than just massage that you’re really passionate about?</strong></p><p>I tell people all the time, massage found me. I thought my life was going to be a Carrie Bradshaw, Sex and the City, I’m living the nightlife in New York City, which is my hometown and that was my lifestyle for a little while. I would do my little 9:00 to 5:00, then I would cover shows, interview artists and get home crack of dawn and getting up again and take the train to do my 9:00 to 5:00. I just felt very unfulfilled.</p><p>I’m interviewing all these top-notch artists and I feel very unfulfilled. I’m like, “There’s something else that I need to be doing in my life in addition to what I’m doing now.” I played with massage since I was like seventeen, always knew the craftsmanship of my hands overcoming pediatric trigger thumbs. What that is my thumbs were born bent. If you look at my thumbs, I don’t have an arch. There’s no joint.</p><p>Hearing like little nuggets like that from your family and your mother and your cousins and it wasn’t until my beloved grandmother, Eloise Stell Grant, second queen in my life, God bless her soul, I massaged her. That’s when she said that I was going to have another career utilizing my hands and they’re going to help people. My cousin Hassan, God bless his soul he was like, “Ma, I’m telling you, I know Dom is a writer, I get all that, but her hands are too gifted to not be doing something with them.” This is crazy.</p><blockquote>Massage therapists combine their scientific knowledge and evidence-based practice with their intuitive nature.</blockquote><p>My cousin was an athlete, so sometimes, I would just compress him on his back and I felt the like his tension was fading. That was like a turning point and the same thing for my mother. We just played around with it, we tried to utilize a lot of networking, we had over years. I was going to massage schools, going into open houses and I just did not feel comfortable with some of the massage schools that were offered in New York.</p><p>I picked around with it again. My grandfather gave me $100 for my 25th birthday and I used that money to apply to massage school. I went back to my alma mater. When you graduate from a CUNY school, the credits transfer. My education looked funny like here she is with this whole Master’s degree and now she’s going to this community college but I didn’t care. It was like if I don’t do it now, I wasn’t going to do it at all.</p><p>My mother knew that this was something I always wanted to do. She felt like the timing wasn’t better at the time because she was like, “You just graduated with your Masters. What are you doing?” I said, “Ma, I got to do it.” I didn’t care. It took me three and a half years to finish because I worked part-time. I was taking a bus to a train to a bus 3 days a week, doing a 9:00 to 5:00. The science courses in massage therapy, you would think. It was a 9:00 to 4:00. That commute kept me motivated. I have to do this two-hour commute, I have to finish this program.</p><p>I love my other degrees, I tell people that all the time, but this one was so impactful because I was out of my comfort zone. From the time I was in grammar school, I always did well in school. Massage therapy challenged that. I would not be the massage therapist I am if it was not for my massage program in Queens. I would not be.</p><h3>Why Massage Therapy Is More Than Just A Luxury </h3><p><strong>You’ve done a phenomenal job, though, of actually incorporating both and why you’re such an authority in that area but I think a lot of times, people think of massage therapy as just a luxury or an extra item. From a real practical standpoint, how does from your perspective massage therapy really help to regulate your nervous system and why is it so critical for, let’s say, high stress employees, professionals, entrepreneurs or business owners like a lot of our audience is?</strong></p><p>It affects all your eleven body systems, especially your nerve and your endocrine. I tell people all the time, “You need your nerves and you need your endocrine, the balance of your hormones. You need your nervous system to send you the signals to do the things that you’re doing with your muscles and your bones.” I tell people, “Think of a massage therapist as your mechanic. Instead of you going to a mechanic to rewire your nervous system and your muscles, you come to us.”</p><p>When I said that to a client one day, he was like, “That makes a lot of sense.” I said, “When you get massages, we are rewiring your nervous system for not to be in a very flight or fight mode. You have the importance of circulation, you have the importance of your endorphins, your dopamine. All these neurotransmitters are taking place while you’re massaging. Your nerves have to be sedated or they have to be stimulated.”</p><blockquote>Massage therapy is muscle awareness supporting stress alleviation that generates endurance in the muscles.</blockquote><p>That’s why I tell people massage therapy is not a luxury. It was a lot of ologies, and think about it, we are the extension of nursing. There are so many ologies in massage therapy. There’s psych, there’s sociology, there’s kinesiology, this is a study of movement, there’s myology, study of muscles, there’s anatomy and physiology. I can go on. Pathology, we have to know the study of diseases to figure out which type of movement is best for you based on your medical condition.</p><p>We have to think about lymphatic drainage, we have to think about your circulatory system, your lymphatic system. All of that matters. Even though it’s not a popular body system, but the lymphatic system is important because how that transport of that fluid determines how much blood flow is going back into your heart, it’s going back into those other capillaries or those smaller vessels. We have to play into all of those things and put that scientific knowledge and that evidence-based practice along with our intuitive nature as massage therapists.</p><p>When you break it down to people, they’re like, “I didn’t know how deep it was.” It was STEM. I think I’m very fortunate since COVID. It made people realize, “I can really get medical massages through insurance, through my HSA account, through the Veteran Affairs.” I think people really started understanding that we are health care professionals and it’s unfortunate that it took COVID to happen but because of COVID, we’re becoming more respected in the health care industry. I give my flowers to nurses, male or female, because we are the extension of nursing.</p><h3>Understanding The Core Philosophy Of TRIBE </h3><p><strong>You said something earlier that I think is so true and that is, this is not just for health or preventative. If you are, for example, reading this and you are a high-achieving or high-functioning entrepreneur, business professional, C-suite person, and you want to perform at your highest level, this is why professional athletes put as much into recovery and all types of therapies that they can do. You can't just perform at a high level without that. Your body and your mind and your energy and all those things are going to feed the results you get in your life.</strong></p><p><strong>Yes, your health is going to be better. Yes, you'll stress less. Yes, you'll get certain things but there's a reason I do that as well as far as frequent massage but I think you're making a point that you're pretty modest about and that is I don't think that necessarily all massage puts as much into it as you do. Your background, certainly, makes it more effective. Decades of doing different things from journalism and storytelling to massage therapy and wellness, you're starting to combine this all together and to do what you love. You have this core philosophy called TRIBE. Explain to me what that is.</strong></p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/6973519e566849f3fdd496e6_Graphics%20-%20Host%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Dr.%20Dominique%20Carson.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Dominique Carson | Massage Therapy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I love acronyms. From what time I was a child, I loved playing with acronyms in different words and it helped me while I was in massage school. I'm in the field and I wanted to do something creative. I thought of about the coloring book. I was like, “People can color, they can get affirmations and then we going to get educated about massage therapy.”</p><p>I thought about what touch requires and being a sexual abuse survivor myself, why touch is so important? The TRIBE acronym is Touch Requires Integrity and Boldness Effortlessly. I think that bonus because I have to step into that room and let you know that I am a professional, that I am a licensed professional and that you're going to respect me as a licensed professional. That's that boldness coming in.</p><p>The Integrity of the craftsmanship of my field, this is something that I take seriously, in addition to my passion. Now that I am an entrepreneur, it’s like business first, craft second. That's why I really have to be bold in that now that I'm self-employed full-time. That's how the acronym came about. I was inspired based on the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit. That was my influence.</p><p>I thought about the nine fruits. I said, “I think this is going to be my acronym.” It became a coloring book. We just released an educational version of<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1968061665"" target=""_blank""> <em>TRIBE</em></a>, which is available on Amazon. When the coloring book received its accolades and his recognition, that's what I wanted to be. I wanted to be something creative and yet educate people and why massage therapy because basically, massage therapy is muscle awareness, supporting stress alleviation and then generating endurance in your muscles.</p><p>I want to explain it to a point where a ten-year-old can understand what massage therapy is and that was the gateway for me to release that coloring book. It became a coloring exercise. For a lot of other people that are not necessarily massage therapists, or had those apprehensions about massage therapy and then it became a help from massage their theirs themselves to incorporate their own self-care.</p><p><strong>There are a couple of points I want to make. One is that this is a great example on the surface of why certain individuals in their craft become authorities. Meaning a lot of people have interests or jobs or professions but they dabble. When you go deep, that’s when you come across things like Dominique you’re talking about with your acronyms as well as your study and your expertise in this area.</strong></p><p><strong>I wanted to point out that no matter what you’re doing in your careers, it’s important to go deep. If y you really truly want to be successful at something you’ve got to do that. Also, in addition to the fact that there are health benefits of massage that you need to prioritize both your mind and body when you’re being a high performing individual or high achieving individual, there are so many other reasons that that’s important in your life.</strong></p><h3>How Grief Can Reshape Focus And Clarity </h3><p><strong>I want to shift gears for a minute. You have experienced some significant personal loss in the in the last little while. You’ve been pursuing and building your dreams and now your Doctorate. I think a lot of people are dealing with things in their life. Now it might be on a surface level stress or anxiety or it might be a deeper thing. A lot of times, loss can really create a rift in your life, make you pivot in your life or even go deeper in what you’re doing in your life. How has loss or grief or things that you’ve struggled with recently reshaped your purpose and focus and clarity on what you’re doing?</strong></p><p>First and foremost, I’m human myself. I think that’s why I love my field. It keeps me in touch with my humanness and that I have to exercise my self-care to be the best professional that I am to other people, especially I’m in a very stress-relieving profession. I lost two uncles I love to my core. One of them, I like to call him my creative arts mentor. That was my Uncle Ricky. I would not be the storyteller, I would not be the massage therapist I am without that man.</p><p>His gift for alternative medicine was phenomenal. We have a family friend. He was just telling my mom this. I think because they call him P-like Peoples. “He passed the torch to your daughter.” I felt like very honored he said that. Here’s my Uncle Rodney. I like to call him my ironwood of carpentry. My uncle could nearly build anything. He was my favorite for a lot of reasons.</p><p>He brought a lot of humor in my life, taught me the importance of integrity, not letting anybody take advantage of you because you are a bookworm and that you have to still be alert. That was his biggest thing. When I was younger, he was so fixated on my innocence, not being tainted as much as it could outside of life circumstances. That one hit me the most because I just mended my relationship with him eleven months earlier.</p><p>We were very close and we went through this very bitter feud for five years. When my uncle reached out, it was like we didn’t miss a beat. We didn’t miss a beat and like I said, at times, there was a very niece-daughter relationship. It’s been very hard. I think about the lessons he’s taught me. He would have been very proud. That was the last thing he was saying a lot to me lately. “I’m very proud of you. You took it to a whole another level.”</p><p>I lost both my uncles to health issues. Now that’s shaping me about thinking about health across the board. I tell people I’ve accomplished a lot but I would not be sitting here right now without God’s grace and the people that are near and dear in my life. As I said, this is a very difficult phase for my uncle’s sons, my mother, his siblings, relatives, you name it.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/697351b6cfd97a9c5d88846e_Graphics%20-%20Guest%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Dr.%20Dominique%20Carson.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Dominique Carson | Massage Therapy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>You’ve really done a good job, though. People are dealing with some really difficult situations out there, and maybe it wasn’t all the case. It seems like you’ve really tried to find some meaning in it and it’s driven you even deeper into something you’re passionate about. You mentioned they both had health problems.</strong></p><p><strong>Are you just someone who naturally saw that or did it take a little bit of work? How do you use that to become, which I think from what we’ve talked about, now a driver for you? The reason I ask this question is I think for a lot of people, how you react or respond or deal with things in your life are either going to make you stronger or they’re going to set you back. Maybe it’s a little bit of both. How did you do it?</strong></p><p>I thought about what my uncles would want, first and foremost, especially my Uncle Rodney. Especially what he told his sons like, “The work don’t stop. Don’t use me as an excuse to not fulfill your goals and your dreams.” When my cousin, his baby son, told me that, I said, “Yes, that is Uncle Rodney. That is Rodney Hugh Peoples. That is something he would definitely say. I thought about what my Uncle Ricky told me. “Continue to follow the yellow brick road.”</p><h3>Challenges Of Pursuing Further Education </h3><p><strong>You were looking for the lesson and I think that’s so true. You hear that a lot, turn your mess into your message, turn your obstacles into your drive and your fire. I think that’s something that has driven you further. What made you decide to go and get a further Doctorate? Is it just your love of education?</strong></p><p>No. &nbsp;I was fine. I was fine with massage, I was fine with my honorary. My cousin Sean, who I call Primo, we were talking about honorary we was talking about PhDs from COVID. He was telling me about a school he was in and I was just like, “I don’t know if I want to do that, Primo. I been going to school since forever. I need a break.” I had another colleague from college and my college mentor was like, “I know how you feel about PhDs.” I thought to me, I wouldn’t do it unless I was planning to teach at a university. One of them was like, “Look into the online, especially your lifestyle right now. It’s self-paced. A lot of things have changed, I promise you, especially COVID.”</p><p>I looked at LIGS University for a while. They kept coming up on my news feed. I’m like, “What’s this school at in Hawaii? I don’t have time.” It was online and I liked their values, their ethics, it’s self-paced and they give you 2 to 3 years. You’re a part of this academic network that takes care of your tuition and they support your dissertation topic.</p><p>When I was talking about it with my mom, the first thing she asked me was, “Did God tell you to do that?” I talked to her because I called my husband and partner on purpose and he’s like, “Did God tell you to do that?” I have two people asking me so I thought about this in prayer. I found out that I was accepted in April. I didn’t make a final decision in October because I needed to make sure that this is something that’s important for me or necessary to do in my life and it was like I got the green light.</p><p>Now I figured out why I got the green light because now, this is an advanced level of writing that I can educate people, especially the two people I just lost and how their health affected it. I’m like, “I can go in this lane, have free range,” and then I found out that the founder of the school is going to be helping me with my dissertation topic. That’s huge.</p><p><strong>Opportunities come along the way. It’s interesting because I am a big believer in lifelong learning and I’m not telling people they got to go out and get a degree, but I think lifelong learning is just a process by which other things can happen. When we were talking before, your ongoing learning is actually helping you to frame how you’re running your business as well as how you’re intersecting both education and holistic healing and all that type of stuff, correct?</strong></p><p>Yeah, absolutely. I can just hear one of my uncles now like, “My Nikki is a whole doctor.” We talked about this when he was still alive and he was like, “I want you to do it, but I want you to do it on your terms.” My uncles were very simple with words but it had impact. He’s always been that way. I said okay.</p><p><strong>For people that are reading, a lot of times, there’s a lot to be said, and we don’t have time to necessarily go down this rabbit hole, but completing things for yourself, accomplishing things that help you to build both your focus, your clarity, your narrative, your confidence, all these types of things. Sometimes they come in small ways, sometimes they come in big ways.</strong></p><h3>Dispelling Misconceptions About Massage Therapy </h3><p><strong>For you, this is a milestone as well, so I think that’s pretty important for you, even though, as I mentioned before, you’ve got such a high degree of a credibility in this field. I do want to ask you one other question before we get going. For people that are not familiar with massage therapy or have not been using it and they look at it as just a luxury, what are some of the misconceptions people have that they should be aware of? Where should they start if they’re interested in trying to get into a little bit more holistic massage whatever it is in order to optimize their overall performance?</strong></p><blockquote>Take action with intention and change your priorities to match opportunities.</blockquote><p>I would say really talk to an experienced licensed professional. You can get like a synopsis. I’m willing to do that as well, tell you what massage therapy is because it’s more than a luxury. It’s like what I said to you, massage therapy is muscle awareness, supporting stress alleviation, generating endurance in muscle. I think a lot of people are apprehensive because of what they heard, lack of education, ignorance, or violation of touch.</p><p>We don’t think about that aspect of it. When you’ve been violated, your touch has been violated, it’s been compromised. That’s a very difficult situation. I hate to say it. Unfortunately, a lot of other massage providers forget that aspect of it and be a part of that touch violation. That’s why we have such a stigma in this field, unfortunately.</p><p>That’s why we refrain from people calling us masseuses. We are not masseuses. Please do not call us that. If you call me that, I’m not going to answer you. I take pride in what I do I take pride in my education, I take pride in my license. That’s what I’m saying, it goes back to that boldness. I’m coming in the room and letting you know what time it is. I am a licensed professional. I’m not tolerating any debauchery, if it is, I’m terminating your session. I’ve always been that way.</p><h3>Discussion Wrap-up And Closing Words </h3><p><strong>People shouldn’t let their fears or even lack of knowledge or understanding stand in their way because this is truly something that can help benefit you from just a pure optimization standpoint. I totally love that. I’ve enjoyed this conversation. I think there’s a lot of lessons to be learned both from your history, your past, your knowledge, pursuing your career, pursuing things that you love to do.</strong></p><p><strong>If people are reading this and either they have an interest in massage, which is one of the reasons why I wanted to bring on the topic, but also if they have an interest in finding ways to be successful at what they love. All of those are great lessons. Before we take off, though, is there anything that you feel like you would like to say to our audience or any other strategies ideas or points you’d like to make?</strong></p><p>I’d like to leave this message with guests. Align your actions with intentions and change your priorities to match opportunities.</p><p><strong>I love that. You have even doubled down even further on that given your losses and focus. I love the message, I appreciate you being here with me. Folks, if you’re reading this if for the first time, make sure you like and subscribe. We don’t want you to miss any episodes.
