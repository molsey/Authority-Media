<h2>The Power of Positive Affirmations with Dennis Mutuma Mbogori</strong></h2><p><strong>The Authority Formula Podcast</em>!</strong> <strong><strong><strong>Thank you. Thank you, George. I appreciate it. I’m glad we were able to align our schedules because I know you have some powerful stories to share.</p><p>Before we get started, I want to introduce you properly. You were born in Kenya and moved to the U.S. during college. What initially attracted me to our conversation was how you were inspired by John Maxwell’s <em><strong>Affirm Your Greatness: Harnessing the Power of Positive Affirmations</em>. I’m really excited to get into this discussion with you today.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Sure. Thank you, George.</p><p>We arrived in July of ‘99, right in the middle of summer, and settled in Georgia. This was my first time in the U.S. I had traveled within Africa—to Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa—but I had never been to the West before.</p><p>Wow.</strong></p><p>Over time, I realized the main issue was that I was speaking too fast. So I learned to slow down my speech, and that helped a lot with communication.</p><p>One interesting thing I’d like to mention, George, is that when most people migrate from Africa or other countries, the first instinct when shopping is to convert prices into their native currency.</p><p>This is too much</em>, and put it back. It took time for me to accept that I was now in the U.S. and needed to adapt to this currency and cost of living.</p><p>Yeah, that’s such an interesting perspective.</strong></p><p>Believe it or not, I worked for MCI WorldCom, selling long-distance phone service. My pitch would start with, <em><strong>Exactly.</p><p>You're literally trying to adjust to a new language, a new culture, and find a job—all while dealing with rejection as a telemarketer. That’s overwhelming. Most people struggle with just the day-to-day, and here you were, completely changing everything about your life.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>It happened a few years later when I enrolled at Beulah Heights Bible College in Atlanta.</p><p>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em> by John Maxwell. We went through it over the semester, covering about a chapter a week.</p><p>If you’re interested in coaching or starting a speaking career, email us, and we’ll get back to you.</em></p><p><strong>Yes. The thought never left me. I kept watching John Maxwell’s <em>Wow, this is really interesting.</em></p><p>If you’re interested in our coaching program, click the link in the description.</em></p><p><strong>It was twofold.</p><p>Where are you from? What do you want to do? How long will you be here?</em></p><p>I started consuming even more John Maxwell material, signed up for Audible, and listened to tons of audiobooks—not just on Maxwell, but on motivation, mindset, and personal growth. I also listened to Grant Cardone and other speakers in the personal development space.</p><p>Was it because the content was helping you personally, or were you drawn to personal development as a career?</strong></p><p>And there was one particular law in <em>Law of Big Mo (Momentum)</strong>.</p><p>So I kept circling back to that chapter, trying to understand, <em>That’s when I started diving deep into researching, watching YouTube videos, listening to audiobooks, and actively seeking out ways to create momentum in my life.</p><p>That’s powerful. And it all came full circle when you started writing your book.</strong></p><p>One day, I received an email newsletter—it was probably one of those that usually go to junk mail. But this one caught my attention. It said, <em>I clicked the link, and they sent a book template along with a step-by-step guide: <em><strong>Exactly. I gathered quotes that resonated with me, wrote my introduction, and shared my journey on leadership, motivation, and goal setting.</p><p><strong>Where do I get a book cover? How do I format it?</em> I figured it all out.</strong></p><p>That’s incredible.</strong></p><p><strong>Absolutely. Taking that first step builds momentum.</p><p><strong><strong>I say those things all the time, but it doesn’t help me.</em> Why did you pick that topic? Help me understand a little bit about positive affirmations in your book.</strong></p><p>It relates to my background and my upbringing. Back home in Kenya, I was the firstborn son. I have two younger brothers and a younger sister, and growing up, I don’t think my parents intentionally meant it, but especially my father—when I didn’t do things right, he’d say things like, <em>When you hear statements like that, especially as a child, they seep into your subconscious.</p><p>You graduate from high school, but there’s this inner voice that says, <em>And when I had time to sit down, I started reading books. I came across a book by Zig Ziglar that had a collection of quotes, many relating to affirmations and changing your mindset. That’s when I decided to become my own doctor. I diagnosed myself out of negative thinking.</p><p>I love that. "Diagnose yourself out of that negative thinking."</strong></p><p>neuroplasticity</strong>—the way affirmations physically change the structure of your brain. I thought, <em>It’s very easy to say, <em>I’m a preacher on Sundays, and I tell people how to live their lives and everything. But then come Monday morning, I’m going to work, and I’m like, <em>That’s when I started researching neuroplasticity and the power of affirmations. I learned that speaking affirmations to yourself, looking in a mirror, or putting sticky notes on the wall and repeating those statements can actually change you and how you live your life.</p><p>I love that, though. You hit a couple of really important things. One is that you decided to diagnose yourself and make a change. That’s cool. I haven’t heard that before.</strong></p><h3>Affirm Your Greatness</strong></h3><p>I want to note for the listeners because you probably forget you’ve done this, but your title really appealed to me. Your title is not just <em>Affirm Your Greatness</em>. I think that speaks to the fact that you’re not just trying to become something great. You’re already something great. You're just trying to have the tools to bring it out. Speak to that for a minute.</strong></p><p>Affirm Your Greatness</em> actually implies that you have greatness in you. It’s just that you have to peel off the layers—like peeling an onion or cabbage—and get to the core of your greatness. You need to get to the core of who you are meant to be, who you were created to be.</p><p>God doesn’t make junk</em>.</p><p><strong>Even if you don’t become a motivational speaker, I guarantee you have a story inside of you. You just have to dig deep, get rid of the negative self-talk, and find what makes you passionate. What makes your heart sing? What gets you excited in the morning?</p><p>Thank God it’s Friday</em>, but we should be thankful every day. We should be excited every day, whether it’s Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. We should wake up with zest and enthusiasm for life.</p><p>Affirm Your Greatness</em> is a handbook to remind you that greatness is already inside you. You just have to bring it to the forefront.</p><p>I love it. I love it. And I loved some of the sections of the book. I haven’t finished it yet, but I’m a quick reader, and I loved it because you’ve put the science behind it. You talk about crafting your affirmations, integrating them with your life, overcoming limiting beliefs, and even applying them to health, wellness, and finance. There’s a section for all of that.</strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Absolutely. That’s exactly what I realized. You can sit around and read all the books in the world, but if you don’t apply what you learn, nothing changes.</p><p>Law of Big Mo (Momentum)</em> stuck with me so much. I kept feeling like my life wasn’t moving forward, but I didn’t realize at the time that <strong><strong>Yes! And sometimes that action is just a small step. When I finally clicked on that John Maxwell link after 10 years, it was a small decision—but it changed everything.</p><h3>Overcoming Self-Doubt and Finding Purpose</strong></h3><p>I want to ask you this because I know there are people listening right now who are struggling with self-doubt. Maybe they feel overwhelmed with life and don’t even know where to start. What advice would you give someone who feels stuck? Where should they begin?</strong></p><p>Your life has a purpose.</em></p><p>And I know that might sound simple, but the first step in overcoming self-doubt is to remind yourself daily that <em><strong>One thing that really helped me was writing down affirmations. I would write statements like:</p><ul><em><em><em>If you need a reminder, put them on sticky notes around your house or write them in your phone’s notepad. Read them every day. Say them out loud. Because what you repeat to yourself becomes your reality.</p><p>That’s powerful. And I love what you said earlier about picking a purpose. Because so many people are stuck waiting to “find” their purpose—but the truth is, you can create a purpose.</strong></p><p>If you don’t know what your purpose is yet, pick something. Work on something. Learn something. Pursue something. And along the way, you’ll discover what you were meant to do.</strong></p><p>If I had never taken that leadership course in Bible college, I wouldn’t have read John Maxwell’s book. If I hadn’t clicked on that link years later, I wouldn’t be a certified speaker today. If I hadn’t started researching affirmations, I wouldn’t have written my book.</p><h3>Daily Rituals for Success</strong></h3><p>I ask a lot of my guests this question because I think habits and daily rituals are so important. Do you have a set of daily rituals that you follow? Something that keeps you grounded and moving forward?</strong></p><p>Every morning, before I get out of bed, I pray. That’s how I start my day—by centering myself.</p><p>inspirational music, podcasts, or audiobooks</strong>. I rarely consume traditional news because there’s just too much negativity.</p><p><strong>Absolutely. If all you consume is negativity, you’ll feel negative. If you fill your mind with inspiration and wisdom, you’ll feel empowered. It’s that simple.</p><p><strong><strong>The best place would be my website:<a href="https://dennismotivates.com">DennisMotivates.com</strong></a>. Everything is there—my books, my blog, and my speaking engagements.</p><p>Awesome. I’ve been on your site, and you have a lot of great content—affirmations, motivational blog posts, and personal growth tips. So for everyone listening, I’ll include a link in the show notes. Make sure to check it out.</strong></p><p>Dennis, it’s been a pleasure having you on the show. Any final words for our audience before we go?</strong></p><p>The people you surround yourself with matter.</strong></p><p>Whether that’s through books, podcasts, or real-life friends, make sure you have a support system that lifts you up.</p><p>I love that. Because the truth is, most of us naturally lean toward negativity. And if you don’t have people around you who counter that, it’s easy to stay stuck.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>The Daily Mastermind</em> Facebook or Instagram, and let’s keep the conversation going.</strong></p><p>Dennis, thank you so much for being here today.
