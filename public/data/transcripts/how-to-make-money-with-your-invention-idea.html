<h2>How to Make Money with Your Invention Idea with Brian Fried</strong></h2><p>‍</strong></p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast. George Wright III here. And we have something very unique for you today. So let me give you a quick intro to this amazing individual.</strong></p><p>He's an inventor, entrepreneur, and public speaker. He's got 15 patents and licensed products—ones that you probably see every day. You didn't even realize it—it’s going to blow your mind. He’s the founder of Inventor Smart. I could go on and on. I'm going to have him give some of his accolades, but he's been featured on <em>New York Times,</em> and <em>Thank you so much, George. I'll tell you, man, two ships passing in the night a lot of times, but we are together and we are going to drop some value bombs here.</p><p>So let me start out, even though I gave you a little intro, let me have you give us a quick idea. We're going to be talking today about inventions and taking people's ideas and making them tangible.</strong></p><p>How do you make money with them? How do you go to the next level with them? But you are by far the authority that I’ve found in this area from the research I've done and the conversations we've had. So share with me and our listeners your journey. What got you into this vein? Why are you so passionate about it? Give us that backstory before we get into some of the details.</strong></p><p><strong>I think, George, when I first started to realize that I was an inventor, I started to look and see things that people were doing. I was a pretty good people watcher and noticed things that annoyed me. I thought, "You know what? I think I’m onto something here."</p><p id="">I continued to jot down my ideas, had a pretty decent-sized spreadsheet, and started to categorize them. I asked myself, "Wait a second, is this only for me, or is this for other people? Is there a big enough market for this, or is it something niche that maybe I might make something on? But where's my opportunity? Where’s that <em id="">aha</em> moment to say, 'You know what? This is something that I'm going to take to the next level.'"</p><p><strong>Absolutely. One of the first ones that I actually brought to life was called the <em>It was a nylon wristband that had a metal D-ring on the outside of it and some Velcro—otherwise known as hook-and-loop in the industry.</p><p><strong>Yeah, there’s no reason to buy another balloon after intermission because all the kids are bawling and upset. So I came up with this wristband to keep my daughter’s balloon on the ribbon attached to the D-ring. You could take it on and off. It was also a weight, so the balloon wouldn’t fly away. You could easily put it on a wrist, belt buckle, or stroller without cutting off circulation. But again, that was something niche and a really inexpensive item.</p><p>I looked at the top of the roll and realized it was dirty—dried up with orange juice or tomato sauce. I asked friends and family to send me pictures of their paper towel rolls, and it was disgusting.</p><h3>Advice for Aspiring Inventors</strong></h3><p>I know that a lot of people now have really amazing ideas, but most everyone goes, "Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if you could do this?" But then they think, "Ah, I could never... like, I could never get that done. Inventions are not something the average person can do."</strong></p><p id="">The first thing I say, George, is, "Is it yours?" I understand that you searched on Google on page one with your eyes closed because you didn’t want to find it.</p><p id="">Or you went down the aisle of Walmart or your favorite store and said, "Oh my gosh, it’s not out there. I’m going to be a gazillionaire. This is it. This is the one," right?</p><p>And it’s the same thing with an invention or an idea for a business product—whatever you’re doing. You do your due diligence; you do your research. What’s going to make you different from anything else out there? Is it something you should put your time, money, energy, and effort into?</p><p><strong id="">I love it. And we’re both marketers as well. So it’s funny because I say that to people a lot. They’re like, "I’ve got this amazing idea," and they just go after it, spending money and doing whatever. I ask, "Have you looked at what the competitors are doing? Have you done your market research? Have you done this or that?"</strong></p><p>It’s like measure twice, cut once, right? So I think that’s great, very wise advice. I think people will learn the more they get to know you that it’s not just an unrealistic thing to think you can make money with an invention or an idea, but it’s super smart to start in the right place.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>George, I’ve been an inventor for many years. Actually, being an inventor coach and going through this process, listening to people—it’s been over 18 years now.</p><p>When somebody comes to me with something, I can almost see where it’s going. But you know what? Every person, every product, every idea is different.</p><p>I think it’s really important to assess what you want to do and how you want to do it. That’s step one. Then I go back to where you are and help you get to where you want to go.</p><p>Then you want to figure out what it’s going to look like. I chicken-scratch a drawing or create something tangible. I used to take my daughter’s toys and rip them apart to create a prototype. I find existing items to make things easier along the way.</p><p>There’s a lot of steps. Then I might want to trademark it. After all that, I’d ask: What’s next? Do I license it to earn royalties?</p><p>If I’m going to present something, I want to provide a competitive advantage in the market. I want to offer IP that someone can rent the rights to and, as they sell it, pay me royalties.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Sure. Let’s break it down.</p><p>One night, I had no room in my fridge. I had a carton of eggs, and there was one egg left. That annoyed me. So I created a collapsible tray where, as you remove eggs, the tray takes up less space. I call it <em>This is a utility patent because it has a function.</p><p>Paper Towel Topper,</em> which is ornamental. That’s a design patent.</p><p>So, let me clarify—if I have a logo, I can trademark it, and once it’s used in commerce, it becomes a registered trademark. But what about a system, like a seven-step process we take people through? Could that be patented, or is it something that would be copyrighted instead?</strong></p><h3>Class of Goods and Trademark Protection</strong></h3><p><strong>Daily Mastermind</em> brand. But does it make sense to register in multiple categories to avoid conflicts?</strong></p><p><strong>Domain names themselves aren’t traditionally classified as intellectual property, but they can be an important part of your brand. Here’s what I recommend:</p><ul>Secure the domain early.</li><li><strong>JoinTheEvolution.com</em> as the hub for my academy. Based on what you’re saying, I should think about trademarking the name itself, not just relying on the domain.</strong></p><p><strong>That’s a critical point. Inventors often get so attached to their ideas that they skip essential steps like research. Before you get too invested, ask:</p><ol><strong><strong><strong>That’s where Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) come in. Before discussing your idea with anyone, have them sign an NDA. It’s a simple yet powerful way to protect yourself.</p><p><strong>For those listening who have an idea but don’t know where to start, what’s your advice? Start with these steps:</p><ol>Do your research. Make sure your idea is original and viable.</li><li>Think about your market. Who will buy this, and why?</li></ol><p>And where can people find you if they want guidance?</strong></p><p id="">The best place is my website,<a href="https://www.brianfried.com"><strong><strong><strong>‍</p><p><strong>Brian Fried, “The Inventor Coach,” ignites innovation.
