George Wright III here. &nbsp;Today, we have a special treat. I’m excited to continue our <em><strong id="">Doug Noll’s story is extraordinary. Born partially deaf, nearly blind, and crippled, he overcame those challenges to graduate from Dartmouth College and pursue a 22-year career as a lawyer. He likes to say he’s a "lawyer turned peacemaker." Doug has transitioned from practicing law to groundbreaking work in de-escalation and conflict resolution, impacting thousands of lives.</strong></p><p>Doug is a mediator, trainer, coach, and bestselling author of four books. His work has earned numerous accolades, including <em>I’m doing great, George. Thanks for having me on the show.</p><p>I’ve been learning more about your journey, and I have to say, transitioning from lawyer to peacemaker is quite the pivot. Let’s dive into your backstory. What inspired you to make that shift?</strong></p><p><strong>It didn’t happen overnight, that’s for sure. I attended Dartmouth College, majored in English literature, and eventually went to law school. After working for an appellate judge for a year, I joined a private practice in central California in 1978. My first jury trial was two months later, and my second was a seven-month securities fraud case worth $36 million in federal court. That’s how my career started.</p><p>Tai Chi teaches two paradoxes: The softer you are, the stronger you are and the more vulnerable you are, the more powerful you are.</p><p>That’s profound. Those principles can apply to life and business, too.</strong></p><p>What am I doing here?</em> That moment changed everything.</p><h3>Pursuing a New Path in Peacemaking</strong></h3><p>‍<strong>“listening others into existence.”</em> You also emphasize listening to emotions, not words. Can you explain the difference between emotional intelligence and emotional competency, and how they tie into this concept?</strong></p><p><strong>No, but by learning and practicing skills like emotional self-awareness and empathy, you can improve your emotional intelligence score. One powerful tool for this is called affect labeling, which I’ve refined over years of practice.</p><h3>Practical Application of Affect Labeling</strong></h3><p>Can you give an example of affect labeling in action?</strong></p><p>“George, you’re really angry and frustrated. You feel disrespected and unappreciated. You’re anxious, worried, and even hopeless.”</em> As I name these emotions, your brain begins to calm down. It works universally—across cultures, languages, and situations.</p><p>How does this apply to leadership?</strong></p><h3>Final Thoughts and Resources</strong></h3><p>Doug, this has been an eye-opening conversation.
