<h2>Emotions Drive Your Behavior with Rob Kalwarowsky</strong></h2><p><strong>It's pretty good. Calver.</p><p>All right. Awesome. Rob, I'm super excited to have you here.</strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Thanks for having me, George. I’m pumped to talk about anything leadership or mindset with you.</p><p>That’s awesome. I know that some people have picked topics that they're passionate about, but this is one that you grew into and found out of necessity. It seems that you have your own story, and I think it would be helpful for the audience to maybe take five minutes or so and just give us your background. Talk to us about what led you from being an MIT grad engineer into leadership in the first place. Obviously, people either find motivation, or they have some kind of problem they’re trying to overcome. So give us just a little taste of your background and what led you into this whole leadership arena.</strong></p><p><strong>And like when I graduated from MIT, for four years they’re telling you, "You’re the smartest person in the world. You’re gonna be a leader. You’re amazing," blah, blah, blah. Then I went into mining—coal mining. I moved out west in Canada, and I started delivering value. I think the first year I worked at this company, I saved them like $30 million. And basically, my boss was like, "We don’t want you to do anything. We don’t want to change. We’ve always done it this way." He had a lot of mindset stuff that I see now that I didn’t see at the time.</p><p id="">But basically, he rejected everything that I did. Constantly, he was passive-aggressive. He micromanaged me a lot. There were a lot of elements there that I found were starting to eat away at my self-concept. From a young age, you do well in the classroom, your teachers tell you you’re wonderful. Then in the pool, it’s the same thing. Your parents are like, "Hey, you’re doing well." And now it’s like, "I’m delivering, but they don’t want it."</p><p>Yeah. Where’s the recognition?</strong></p><p id="">Yeah. Ultimately, it led me down this path of, "What’s my purpose in life? Who am I? Does my life even have any meaning at all?"</p><p><strong>And not long after that, maybe a year later, I tried to kill myself. It was just a slippery slope.</p><p id="">And George, this is the part that I want to emphasize for folks—it’s not just that element. A lot of what we learn in movies is, "Hey, you hit rock bottom, and you’re gonna move to the beach and change your life and do all these things." I didn’t do any of that. I woke up, I went to work. I didn’t change at all. I didn’t know how to change.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong id="">So it seems...was there a point in time where you recognized that? Did you do something? Did you hear something? What made you finally realize that was happening and decide, "Okay, I gotta do something about it"? Was there a pivotal point there—or not? Or was it when you were feeling suicidal? What was it that made you decide, "Okay, I gotta change"?</strong></p><p id="">That was actually in 2019. So that was about eight years later. I never had that realization there. I worked there another year, and then I found another job. I left, and then I worked in another company. And then I ultimately found...I started listening to Gary V, Andy Frisella, and Brendon Burchard, and these guys. I liked Gary V at the time. He was like, "Start a podcast."</p><p><strong><strong><strong>‍</p><h3>The Importance of Environment and Beliefs</strong></h3><p>And so, all those things—and yeah, think about it—a child version of you is telling you how to operate a multimillion-dollar business or to live your life. For me, I was 35. I was an engineer. And the beliefs that I had were around: if I get an A in school, my mom will love me, or my dad will accept me. And this is for folks out there. It’s not just you. My clients all have similar ideas.</p><p><strong id="">It’s funny you say that because a lot of the common message that I talk about is that your beliefs are gonna determine your actions and the steps you take to change your life, right? And people say, "Oh, I want to change my life. I want to make changes." If your actions don’t reflect what you’re saying, then it’s doubtful you really believe it. So that’s why we call them limiting beliefs, right? Because these beliefs you have—you don’t look at them as limited or not—but when you start to realize they are, that you can do more, that’s when you become really empowered. So you decided to start a podcast. I just wanna hit on that for a second.</strong></p><p>Did you have experience with that? Did you have somebody that said, "Let me show you exactly what to do"? You were an engineer, probably a pretty sharp guy, graduating from MIT. How did you...that’s not a simple thing. Most people think...what did you do? How did you just say, "I’m just gonna figure this out"?</strong></p><p id="">I just basically bought a mic off of Amazon, and then I just figured it out. Gary V was like, "Oh, Anchor’s good." And I was like, "All right." So I signed up for Anchor. I had a mic, and then I just started emailing people I knew, and we started recording. I found Zencastr when it was early, and I just started doing it.</p><p><strong><strong>‍</p><h3>From Podcasting to TED Talks</strong></h3><p>No.</p><p>I’m assuming you’re not still doing an engineering podcast.</strong></p><p><strong>It wouldn’t have.</p><p>But starting is what led you there, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Totally. So I started that podcast because I needed to build a brand, as Gary V was saying, so I could get out of corporate and sell. My goal was to do engineering consulting instead of working for bad bosses, which I had my entire career.</p><p><strong>I hired her because I was like, "I have this audience. I want to monetize them. I need help because I don’t know how to do that. I need help doing that."</p><p>I love it, bro. We are on similar paths. I love it because I’m gonna double down and stick a pin in this thing you said. And that is, what you’re saying is: start with something. Guys, listen. Whether you’re in a current business you’re not happy with, whether you’re active at your job, whether you’re doing well or struggling, start with something. But then you noticed he also said he hired a coach.</strong></p><p>At the end of the day, you start with what you know, and then you go to somebody that can help you to take it past that. So how did you choose a coach? I just did a podcast recently on coaches, mentors, and the need for that in your life. How did you find someone? What was your way of finding them? Did you look for a related engineering podcast coach, or did you just look for a personal development coach? Like, how did you find a coach?</strong></p><p>And it was really when I talked to Susan for the first time that I felt like she saw me in ways the other ones didn’t. I didn’t know what that feeling was because I was so dissociated from all the stuff I was still dealing with. It just felt different. And when I’ve coached folks now, often the first session I have with them, people say to me what I basically said to Susan: "Nobody’s ever listened to me the way you have."</p><p>Isn’t that crazy? People just want to be listened to. You just want to be heard. And the challenge a lot of people have is they’re frustrated because they don’t feel heard, but they don’t do anything about it. They just stay frustrated. And, guys, I’m gonna give you like a little jump to the case here.</strong></p><p>Fast forward: this guy’s now in business with his original coach. So talk about going from starting something, hiring a coach, now being in business, doing a TED Talk. We’ll get there in a second, but that’s an amazing transformation. And yet you didn’t have any special leadership knowledge, training, tons of money set aside, or any of that to do it—you just started doing it. That’s crazy.</strong></p><p>How soon after you did your podcast, got your coach, did you do a TED Talk? And I wanted to ask you why you chose to do a TED Talk. What was the point of that? And then let’s walk through the experience of planning and prepping for it, because I don’t know if you’re just a naturally gifted speaker and you love speaking in front of people, but 99% of people don’t. So tell us about the TED Talk and why and how it went.</strong></p><p>I walked into Susan’s office in October of 2019, and I did a TED Talk on a completely different topic than I imagined. When I walked into her office, my thought was, "I’m not a leader. Leadership is basically crap because every leader I’ve ever had was garbage." So I had a negative mindset. Of course, when I was playing polo, I had a couple of great coaches, but my association with leadership in business was: they’re all terrible.</p><h3>Overcoming Nerves and Embracing Meditation</strong></h3><p>Were you just completely nervous, not knowing where it was going? Was it a nerve-wracking deal? In other words, it was obviously way outside your comfort zone, which is where most greatness lies, right?</strong></p><p>But we had a morning rehearsal at the TED Talk, and I did it. It was weird because you’re speaking to an empty room, basically. Then they asked me a few questions as part of the Q&amp;A, and I didn’t feel good about my answers. But what I do is a lot of self-work. We use Internal Family Systems.</p><p>So I’m speaking English, and I have someone translating for me into Cantonese. And for the Q&amp;A, instead of answering questions, we did a guided meditation to help people connect with their true selves so they could make better decisions. And it was just an incredible experience.</p><p>In fact, I just replayed a podcast I did a couple of years ago about how to prepare for a presentation. One of the most important strategies is, number one, be prepared. When preparation meets that event, the fears are less, and the confidence is higher—it’s all about that. But I think the mindset piece is something that I don’t talk a lot about with regards to doing some type of presentation or delivering a powerful message.</strong></p><p>And so I really like that. But I do think for most people, I believe that getting outside your comfort zone—whether you fumble it all up or not—you’re going to come out of it on the other side just feeling like a million bucks. It’s going to take you to a new level, a new plateau that you can bust through.</strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>And so this comes back to the mindset and the limiting beliefs that folks have. I’ll use myself as a playbook for folks because I think it’ll help. I learned that I never accepted myself. I had a belief that I was not accepted. This came from my dad—it doesn’t really matter where it comes from. Typically, your big core beliefs come from your parents, a teacher, or some authority figure when you’re a child. Now, by starting to see that I never accepted myself, I had to go outside myself to get the narrative that I was accepted. This started in school: "Hey, if I get an A, my teacher will accept me, and my parents will accept me because getting an A is reaffirmed." Then it went into the pool. If I’m good at water polo, my coaches will say, "Hey, you’re great," and my teammates will accept me for who I am. And this continued until I was 25. Then I was doing the same strategy: "I’m going to perform," but then my boss didn’t accept me.</p><p>So, mental note for the audience: most people look for validation externally to increase their self-worth and self-confidence. What they don’t identify is the core fire—they deal with the smoke, not the flame, the fire, of why they’re even doing that in the first place. Doing that will never solve the issue. You came to the awareness because you did that most of your life and excelled, and then all of a sudden you weren’t getting that. But you’re really identifying— I want people to understand this—that you do have to do the inner work. Like, you have to do it.</strong></p><p>People hear that a lot. I know it’s a little bit of a ‘fufu’ type deal, but inner work means there’s a core reason that you have problems in your life. It’s a real responsibility thing because what you’re saying is that your external world was affecting you, but you recognized it was your internal world that was causing it. Not just causing it, but not validating it. So you did this work, and you found there was some healing you had to do. There were some things you had to identify. Then how did that lead you into, I guess—you call it setting boundaries and stuff? Once you recognized that, isn’t it a work in progress? That wasn’t something that you just figured out one day, right?</strong></p><h3>Leadership Development and Coaching</strong></h3><p>Now, the big thing is, if we get back to this thing about the 95 to 97%. I want to pull in, George, what you mentioned about going outside your comfort zone and doing a talk. Let’s take that as an example. You’re out there, you’re listening, and George says, “Hey, go do a talk.” You feel something—“Eh, I don’t want to, that stresses me out,” or, “I don’t want to do that.” And maybe you’re the type who says, “I’m just going to push through that discomfort,” right?</strong></p><p>A lot of high achievers say that. They say, “I’m going to push through anyway.”</strong></p><p>But here’s the difference. When you’re doing a talk, if you come across with this energy—if I had done it prior to me trying to heal—I would’ve come across as “accept me.” It would’ve been about me. Doing it now, I’m accepted because I accept myself. So the talk is about the audience and impacting them to go out and make changes in their lives—to either leave the bosses that are abusing them or manage the bosses that can be managed better. It’s the same thing, right?</p><p><strong><strong>For the folks who aren’t doing anything—the reason they’re not doing anything is that you have a belief.</p><p>Yeah. That’s the reason you don’t do anything.</p><p>If you do the inner work and you can change your mind—which you can absolutely do because I’ve done it—you can change your mind. Then you can believe, “I actually can do it.”</p><p>Your brain’s not going to sabotage you. Should I call this person to make a sale or not? If you believe you’re going to fail, you’re not going to call that person.</p><p><strong><strong>Totally.</p><p>We also do group leadership development. So if you have a company and you want to train your leaders—which, here’s a good stat for you: the average person becomes a leader at 29 years old. They only get leadership development training at 42.</p><p>We don’t even let people who cut hair for a living do it without training, and yet we’re saying, “Oh, you’re promoted. You manage these people. Figure it out.”</p><p>Yeah, that’s why. No, that’s huge because I tell people, look—I’ve scaled businesses from small nutrition, fitness, education, and finance-type businesses to a hundred million dollars, done a billion dollars in sales. The quickest way to scale a company is through your leadership. It’s investing in your leadership. Most people bump up against, “Okay, I’m doing everything.” But if you will invest in your leaders—B2B type stuff here—if you invest in your line-level leaders and managers to develop them, number one, you leverage, and your life is much easier. Number two, you grow as well because learning to lead leaders is a growth of its own. Trust me, man. I’ve been there, done that. It is a challenge. But that’s good that you do that.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>If you’re interested—if you have a bad boss or an asshole boss, or if you’ve ever had one, which almost guarantees you have—I have a free eBook for folks.</p><p>Also, if you’re on that website as well, we have a “How to Deal with an Asshole Boss” program.
