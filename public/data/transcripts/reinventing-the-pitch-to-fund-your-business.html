<h2>Reinventing The Pitch To Fund Your Business</strong></h2><p><strong>The Authority Formula Podcast</em>! George Wright III here.</strong></p><p>And I'm joined by what is sure to be an amazingly fun interview with Kent Richardson. How are you doing, brother?</strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Gosh, I like long walks on the beach… How far back do you want me to go? I was wheeling and dealing back in grade school. I was the reason we had Pokémon even revoked from the whole school front.</p><p><strong id="">What’s interesting is I usually start with a question like, "Were you always an entrepreneur?" But I know that back to when you were old enough to talk, you probably were. Just go back and give me an idea of what’s been your career background.</strong></p><p>And were you always an entrepreneur, or did that kind of evolve through just things you were doing growing up?</strong></p><p><strong>It definitely evolved. I, just like anybody else, jumped into the job space. Most of it, though, has been circled around fractional work—a lot of fractional IT companies, fractional CFO, fractional administration with fund administration, and SPV creation.</p><p><strong>Sales. So I was running sales and then jumped into the director of sales, strategic partnership roles, etc.</p><p><strong>It definitely happened on the fluke side of things. However, way back when, I worked for my father, who owned a gun shop years back. He opened it in either ’59 or ’69—one of those dates.</p><p>My mind was always shifting and rolling with just conversations with my old pops, right?</p><p>maybe there's something here that I could innovate or change the game.</em></p><p>That’s where the journey really began. I started a little startup and worked on that for a good chunk of time, which then stirred into various connections with investors, other founders, and the community. I just jumped into that world, not really knowing that it was a world to begin with. But that was really the catalyst that spurred it all on.</p><p><strong>Sh</em>t Pitch*</strong></h3><p>It's interesting because I want to get real heavily into this new out-of-the-box idea you have with your pitch event. I think you laid the groundwork for it. In other words, you've been an out-of-the-box thinker for a while. Was it an aha moment when you started Sht Pitch? And I’m sure people are doing a double take, thinking, “Is he saying that right?”*</strong></p><p>So let’s start with this—what is Sht Pitch? And then let’s back up and help me understand—did you have an aha moment with this, or did it slowly transition into it? How did you lead yourself into this world of what you’re currently doing? And then we’ll break it down.*</strong></p><p>Sh</em>t Pitch*. <em>A lot of investors in the community and abroad don’t just look at the business pitch deck, its valuation, or its requirements. They’re looking at <em>To answer your second question—how did this start? I was working with a really cool group of angel investors and VCs here in Utah, and we were all thinking the same thing: <em>Are we actually doing everybody a service, or are we doing them a disservice with what we’re currently doing?</p><p>So I got a group together, and I said, “Let’s throw out this wild, crazy idea and experiment. Let’s just have some fun. Let’s be human for once and see what happens.”</p><p>let’s make sure they have time for their real business, like a normal pitch event for entrepreneurs. But let’s also give them something that they’re not prepared for—something that lets us see more of who they really are as people.</em></p><p>But what we’re doing is putting these founders in a position to show off—how do they communicate? How do they work through a problem? How do they adapt? Can we see a little bit of that behavior?</p><h3>The Human Element in Pitching</strong></h3><p>I love it. What’s so crazy is that I love that overview, and I had so many questions. I was going to jump in, but I wanted to get the full deal first because now we can go back and unpack it a little bit. I think it's brilliant, and I think you're right—it’s morphed over time. But it starts with this premise that I’ve had in all the companies I’ve built, in raising funds, and in working with investment funds. The idea that most true investors, in the end, will always look at the numbers. But they invest in the people more than the product.</strong></p><p>You could have an amazing product and a horrible founder—or vice versa. So, I think it's a great point for listeners to understand that the person behind the business is just as important. That’s why with our authority marketing company, we emphasize that founders need to be visible. They need to be out there. So I love that.</strong></p><p>You were already working in this space. What made you transition from focusing just on the business pitch to saying, "Let’s throw that out the window and do something different"? Was it a fluke idea? Was it something you felt was missing? What was the moment that made you decide to take this angle?</strong></p><p>So we thought, <em>Through creative conversations and brainstorming with different investors, this idea surfaced as an experiment. I told everyone, “Let’s just try this out.” Even to the founders, I said, “Let’s play a little game. Worst-case scenario, all you’ve had is more time in front of investors.”</p><h3>Breaking the Facade: Humor, Adaptability, and Pressure</strong></h3><p>It’s genius because not only do you get to see their skills—how they adapt, how they think on their feet—but you also get to see their personality. Their humor, their ability to communicate under pressure, all of it.</strong></p><p>And especially today, with AI and everything looking so polished and perfect, I think people crave authenticity. This breaks the ice and forces them to be real. What made you decide to also bring in that improv-style humor? Because it almost feels like an impromptu comedy show, but with real business implications.</strong></p><p>I’m not funny, so I leave the comedy to everyone else. But for those that want a pressure cooker, <em>And here’s the thing—people are naturally more relaxed when they’re in a room watching something lighthearted versus something overly serious.</p><p>How do we bridge that gap?</em></p><p>The bottom line is, you're doing that. And I thought this was brilliant—you have them do this before their real pitch. So investors get a feel for them before they go into their actual business presentation. Do you feel like they try to maintain character knowing their real pitch is coming up, or do you really see them open up? What do you do to put them at ease so they don’t hold back?</strong></p><p>I tell them before they go on stage, “I’m not going to dictate how you should do this. What we want to see is <em>That gives them the freedom to either show off their skills or, in some cases, try to mimic someone else—which usually backfires.</p><p>But <em>‍</p><h3>Investors Reading Between the Lines</strong></h3><p>It’s about understanding <em>That’s the real insight—what makes an effective economy is understanding human behavior. And when we do that right, we actually help founders position themselves better for long-term success.</p><p>I love that. And I wanted to dive deeper into one thing you mentioned earlier—where you said investors can see if someone is lying or stretching the truth during this process. What did you mean by that? And why did you choose to bring that specific aspect into the pitch format?</strong></p><p>We had a founder on stage at one of our CNBC-filmed events. His impromptu topic was <em>But instead of going the comedic route, he said, “I’d like to take a different angle. I have a family member who is deaf, and I want to pitch this idea as a real solution.”</p><p>His delivery had me tearing up. I looked around the audience—there were actual tears.</p><p>half-truths</em> in his pitch because it was a fake idea. But it showed how he communicates, how he builds emotion, how he works through a challenge.</p><h3>Insights on Successful Founders</strong></h3><p>It’s crazy because, at the end of the day, what you’re really uncovering is their ability to adapt. That’s a crucial skill in business. You’re not just testing their pitch—you’re testing their thinking.</strong></p><p>With all the founders you’ve worked with, have you noticed any common characteristics among the ones who are really successful at raising money? Are they usually the natural-born entrepreneurs, or do you find that success comes from something else?</strong></p><p>Some first-time founders come in and absolutely dominate an investor conversation. They can pull investors through their story and get them engaged. But for most founders, success comes down to experience, iteration, and validation.</p><p>Most early-stage founders should not be looking for direct investment.</strong></p><p>A lot of founders get caught up in the mindset of <em>Too many entrepreneurs spend all their energy chasing investment before they’ve built a foundation, and that’s where they get stuck.</p><p>That’s such a great insight because I think most founders assume that the moment they have a great idea, they should immediately seek funding. But what you’re saying is, hold off—get some proof of traction first.</strong></p><p>seed</strong> and <strong>If a company isn’t generating revenue yet, the only exception we make is for life sciences or med-tech companies—because those take longer to reach profitability.</p><p>That’s why, even though we let pre-seed founders participate in the event, they need to have momentum. They need to show progress.</p><p>So what’s the number one trait that you’ve seen among founders who actually get investment?</strong></p><p>It’s always about <strong>I’ve seen founders who weren’t the best public speakers, who weren’t the most charismatic, but they got funding because they could <strong>They weren’t just talking about their vision—they had actual data, traction, and milestones to back it up.</p><p><strong><strong>It comes down to <strong><li>Storytelling</strong> – If there’s no compelling reason behind what you’re building, investors won’t connect with it.</li><li>Team</strong> – You need to know who is on your team, what gaps exist, and how you’re planning to fill them.</li><li>Capital Strategy</strong> – Investors want to know exactly how you plan to use their money. You don’t need to have every detail figured out, but you do need to demonstrate <strong>purpose</strong> behind every dollar you’re raising.</li></ol><p>That last point is so important because a lot of founders just say, "We need $1M for growth," but they don’t have a clear plan for how they’ll allocate it.</strong></p><p>how much</em> you need—they want to know <em>how</em> you’ll use it, and <em>‍</p><h3>The Most Memorable Pitches</strong></h3><p>You’ve done a ton of these events. What are some of the craziest or most memorable pitches you’ve had on stage?</strong></p><p>One of the funniest was <strong><strong>Yeah! The founder was given the prompt <em>And he decided to go all-in on a <strong>He started breaking down actual <strong>reproduction cycles</strong>, how long it takes to train them, and even how to encrypt messages onto pigeons.</p><p><strong>He was actually working in <strong><strong>Oh, that one was great.</p><p>inflatable muscle arms</strong> for people who feel insecure at the pool. So instead of just regular floaties, they would look like buff, muscular arms.</p><p>customizable</em> for different muscle shapes.</p><p>That’s so ridiculous, but I love it.</strong></p><p>Sh</em>t Pitch*—you never know what’s going to happen, but it pushes founders to <strong>‍</p><h3>What’s Next for Sht Pitch?*</strong></h3><p>This is so good. So tell me, what’s on the horizon for Sht Pitch? What’s coming up next?*</strong></p><p>Last year, we launched with 11 events across the country. This year, we’re doing 20 national events.</p><p>And we’re taking it a step further—we’re filming it as a TV pilot to pitch to major networks.</p><p>That’s huge! So this could turn into a full-fledged show?</strong></p><p>The challenge now is bringing it to an even bigger platform and continuing to connect founders with investors in the most authentic way possible.</p><p>That’s incredible. For anyone listening, where can they go to find upcoming events and get involved?</strong></p><p>Sh*tPitch.com</strong>.</p><p>event schedule</strong>, details on how to participate, and opportunities for <strong>‍</p><h3>Final Advice for Founders</strong></h3><p>This has been amazing.
