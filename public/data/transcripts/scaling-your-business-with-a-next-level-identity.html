<h2>Scaling Your Business with a Next Level Identity with Jason Moss</strong></h2><p><strong><strong><strong>Thanks so much, George. I’m glad to be here.</p><p>We got a chance to just get to know each other. And I’ll tell you, we share a lot of similar things. That’s one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on here. So give me a quick background because look, you made your first sale at 13 and you’ve been growing businesses ever since.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Yeah, I’ve always had a passion for really two things. I’ve always been this internet computer nerd. So I love the online world. I made my first sale online when I was, I think, 13 years old. I built this software program that was really designed to help me play video games without putting the CDs in the computer. If anybody remembers that, it was like whenever you wanted to play a game, you’d have to find the CD.</p><p>So really, my journey over the past 20 years has been merging those two things together and building platforms online—from that first product business when I was 13, selling software, to building a platform as a musician when I was in high school on MySpace, to helping grow a multi-seven-figure business as a director of sales, to the work I do today as a business coach.</p><p><strong><strong>‍</p><p>So tell me what you mean by that and help our listeners understand what it takes to do that.</strong></p><p>I would give people the marketing plans and help them dial in their social media strategy. I still do a lot of that today. But what would drive me nuts is I would give the same plan, the same roadmap, to two different coaches. One person would take that and triple their revenue in six months, and the other would stay exactly where they are. For years, I was like, “First, am I just a crappy coach? What is the thing?”</p><p id="">And then on a deeper level, I was like, "What does it actually take? If it's really about strategy—if strategy is really the missing piece—then why is it that most of us already have access to the strategies but still don't see the success we want?"</p><p>Most people, when they think about growing a business, spend 80 to 90 percent of their time—if not 100 percent—exclusively focused on the external. They’re asking, "How do I figure out the right marketing strategy? How do I put together the right content plan?" They wonder why it doesn’t work.</p><p>Yeah, and they want that thing. They want that strategy, that tactic, that silver bullet, whatever it is. But you’re right. They don’t realize it’s the inner game.</strong></p><p>Last year, for example, our business did around $500,000 in sales. I was at this level where I hit a plateau. I was really in this incremental shift and change kind of place. I was optimizing—asking, "How do I do a little more of what I’m doing now? How do I optimize this?" It was fine; it was an important part of business.</p><p>A lot of people don’t think about this. They say, "I want to grow my business to seven figures or multiple seven figures." But if you think of yourself as a six-figure coach or a multi-six-figure business owner, you won’t even be available to the strategy that will take you to the next level. You literally won’t see it. Your mind will filter it out.</p><p id="">Six months ago, I made the commitment. One day I was laying in bed, and I said, "You know what? It’s time." I was praying, saying, "God, I’m available. I’m open. I’m ready. I am ready to become the seven-figure coach. I don’t even know what that looks like, but I’m committing to the identity. I’m committing to becoming the kind of person who can hold the level of success that I want."</p><p><strong>And what’s fascinating is that the strategy feels like it’s fallen into my lap. But it wasn’t intellectual. I didn’t think my way into it. The first thing I did was commit to who I needed to become in order to hold the business I wanted. Suddenly, ideas became available. Things I heard from mentors years ago suddenly clicked into place.</p><p>It all comes back, yeah.</strong></p><p><strong>Exactly.</p><p>Yeah, and it’s not until you really deal with those limiting beliefs, practice visualization, and start doing the inner work that everything you need starts to align externally. Those strategies and tactics matter, don’t get me wrong. But the difference-maker is your internal thermometer, your blueprint. Without that, you’ll never reach the scalability you’re aiming for. It’s essential.</strong></p><p><strong>The biggest obstacle, without a doubt, is that as a culture and society, we’re so fixated on the external. We discount the internal. We talk about mindset, but when you really look at how most entrepreneurs spend their time and energy, they’re focused entirely on external strategies.</p><p><strong>Exactly. And here’s the problem: when you’ve been on that hamster wheel long enough, you start to realize it doesn’t work. You hit a ceiling. You start to feel like you’re recreating the same patterns in your business, your relationships, or your life.</p><p><strong>It’s massive. People say they want to grow their business to $10 million a year, but then you start digging deeper, and there’s resistance. Maybe it’s fear of outgrowing their current relationships. Maybe it’s fear of being criticized by their family or peers. Whatever it is, there’s this subconscious push-pull energy that creates self-sabotage.</p><p>You nailed it. Most people don’t realize they’re validating their limiting beliefs by staying in that cycle. They’re saying, “See? It doesn’t work.” But it’s because their actions aren’t aligned with their words.</strong></p><p><strong>Absolutely. And the moment you align those actions with genuine belief, things shift. It’s like flipping a switch. The resistance fades, and you move forward with clarity and purpose.</p><p><strong><strong>Sure thing. The four pillars I always emphasize are niche, offer, audience, and enrollment. These are foundational for any personal brand-driven or service-based business, especially for coaches or consultants. Let’s break them down:</p><ol><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Honestly, I think it’s a lack of clarity and focus. They think they know their niche, but they haven’t tested it deeply. They have an offer, but it’s not dialed into what their audience really needs. And without building genuine relationships with their audience, their enrollment process feels transactional instead of transformational.</p><p>That makes so much sense. Now, you also talk about achieving greater income with alignment and flow instead of grinding harder. Can you expand on that?</strong></p><p>One of my mentors, Scott Oldford, introduced me to the concept of three levels of consciousness in business: willful, intellectual, and intuitive.</p><ul><strong><strong><strong><strong>Exactly. When you reach the intuitive level, you’re not just working harder—you’re working smarter and more in tune with what feels right. That’s when you truly find flow, and success feels effortless.</p><p>I love that. What would you say to someone who’s ready to make that shift but doesn’t know where to start?</strong></p><p>Once you identify those patterns, start doing the inner work to address them. That might mean hiring a coach, doing mindset exercises, or even journaling to uncover what’s beneath the surface.</p><p>Great advice.
