<h2>‍</p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast, George Wright III here. I am really excited today because we're joined by an amazing individual—someone who’s going to share a lot of knowledge with you. We’re going to touch on everything from leadership to business.</strong></p><p><strong>Be Different</em>, is now in pre-sale. We’re going to dive into it, but Marty, thanks for coming on the podcast, man. It’s good to have you.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Marty Strong's Background and Military Career</strong></h3><p>Sure. So I was born in Nebraska, and I was there until I was about 11 years old. My father started working for the Army—not as a soldier but as an employee—and we ended up spending four years in Japan and two years in Hawaii.</p><p>Most unlikely person you’d think to be a SEAL—I was like 125 pounds when I started and 128 when I graduated. I spent 10 years as an enlisted SEAL. I got my undergraduate degree in business administration and was then selected for Officer Candidate School. I spent the second 10 years as an officer and earned my MBA.</p><p>Eventually, I got picked up by a government contracting company and became the CEO of that company. In 2016, I bought a healthcare company. That was a pure entrepreneurial move—not even early-stage, essentially a startup. It had one employee when I bought it.</p><p> </p><h3>Leadership and Cross-Training in Business</strong></h3><p>So, like me, you’ve had several careers—several different phases and seasons of your life. Do you feel like they led to each other, or were they total pivots for you? Leadership, especially in the SEALs and military, obviously extends into business. But you went from military to banking to business. Did you always have a sense of entrepreneurialism, or did you pivot into business out of necessity?</strong></p><p>When I was an enlisted SEAL, I wanted to learn how to be the best SEAL I could possibly be. I read everything I could about military history and tactics. I’d talk to anyone who had been in combat situations—I was a sponge.</p><p>That process is very similar to startups in business. You’re constantly evaluating your environment, your team, your product, and your services. Then six months later, you might be in a completely different role. It’s constant learning.</p><p>I got to read a lot of analytical reports and see how analysts evaluate companies—their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. That matched up with the skills I learned in the SEALs: mission planning, leadership, and adaptability.</p><p><strong>Two things: one at an operational level and one at a tactical level.</p><p>By the time you’re a senior SEAL, you’ve mastered several areas and can train the next generation. That cross-training creates redundancy and bench strength, which is critical.</p><p>So, in every organization I’ve led, I’ve implemented cross-training models. It creates empathy, understanding, and resilience.</p><p>That’s fascinating. It sounds like you’re not advocating for generalists over specialists but rather creating specialists with broad perspectives. Cross-training provides context and understanding, even if you’re deeply skilled in one area.</strong></p><h3> Scenario-Based Learning and Handling Stress</strong></h3><p>Leaders don’t need to master everything but need enough understanding to make strategic decisions. I think it’s critical, especially for business owners and CEOs, to have a broad understanding while focusing on their core strengths. Let’s dive into that tactical and operational crossover you mentioned earlier.</strong></p><p>In the military, we constantly work through contingency plans. We create entire mission sets for potential scenarios—reviewing them, revising them based on new information, and then putting them back on the shelf.</p><p>For example, you could sit a group of leaders down in a tabletop exercise and say, “Here’s the scenario: our primary supplier just called and said they’re out of raw materials. We have two hours to figure out how to keep production running. Go.”</p><p><strong>Stress is often tied to fear of the unknown. In the military, we practice failure constantly. This builds psychological resilience.</p><p>This kind of training makes failure part of the reality. So when things fall apart in real life, you don’t freeze or panic. You click into action, working the problem and finding solutions.</p><p>I really like how you phrased that—“practice failure.” That’s not something most people intentionally do. Is there a specific reason you used that term instead of something like “practice execution” or “practice success”?</strong></p><p>In the SEALs, everyone is trained in trauma care, even if they’re not a medic. We train for emergency tracheotomies, stopping hemorrhages, and more. In a crisis, everyone knows exactly what to do.</p><p> </p><h3>Opportunities in Crisis and Chaos</strong></h3><p>That’s such a powerful concept—building confidence through preparation. It’s clear that practicing failure removes the fear that often paralyzes people in high-stakes situations. Business leaders could benefit greatly from this approach, especially given how unpredictable the world has been over the last few years. Let’s shift gears a bit. What’s the biggest difference you’ve noticed between military leadership and business leadership?</strong></p><p>First, in the military, you’re surrounded by volunteers who are willing to sacrifice for a mission and for each other. There’s a deep, emotional bond and commitment to the team.</p><p>Second, businesses often lack cross-functional understanding and collaboration. In the military, cross-training fosters empathy and teamwork. Everyone understands how their actions affect the larger mission.</p><p>Yeah, that makes so much sense. Cross-functional collaboration not only builds empathy but also creates a more resilient and adaptable organization. I think many business leaders could benefit from adopting that mindset. Speaking of resilience, in your book <em>Sure. In the military, if everything goes perfectly during a mission, leadership isn’t really required. It’s a testament to the team’s training and preparation.</p><p>The same applies in business. If you’ve trained your team well, they’ll be able to handle challenges effectively. But when chaos hits, it’s also an opportunity for individuals to step up, show their capabilities, and grow as leaders.</p><p><strong>Be Different</em>. What inspired you to write it, and how does it build on your previous books?</strong></p><p>Be Different</em> came from my experience on the board of Best Robotics, an organization that conducts robotics competitions for 6th to 12th graders.</p><p>Adults, on the other hand, often lose their creativity because they’ve been conditioned to follow rules and stay within set boundaries. <em>‍</p><p>That’s fascinating. For business owners and CEOs, how can they foster an environment of creativity while maintaining discipline and execution?</strong></p><p>At the same time, be willing to challenge your own assumptions and strategies. Just because something worked in the past doesn’t mean it will work in the future. The world is constantly changing, and your business needs to evolve with it.</p><p><strong><strong>They can visit my website,<a href="http://martystrongbenimble.com">If you’re facing operational challenges, start with <em>Be Visionary</em>.
