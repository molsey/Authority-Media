<h2>‍</p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast. We’ve got a really good topic today—one that I’ve been familiar with for a while. It’s great that we’re finally able to get together because I want to share some topics today that you’re an expert at. With The Daily Mastermind, we’re always talking about ways people can increase their life and their lifestyle—whether it’s their mind, money, body, or business. This episode is going to be one of those wealth planning discussions.</strong></p><p>If you don’t know Dale, he’s a seasoned real estate investor specializing in U.S. tax liens and tax deeds. He’s also one of the founders of Certainty Investment Group, a firm known for providing investors with 12–15% annual returns fully secured by real estate. Dale is passionate about simplifying the often complex state and county tax sale process. This conversation dives into what many consider one of the best-kept secrets of the high net worth—tax liens and deeds.</strong></p><p>Understanding Tax Liens and Deeds</h3><p>Could you start out by giving us a bit of your background? You started pursuing bank foreclosures before moving into tax liens and deeds. What brought you into this whole category of investing?</strong></p><p>Tax sales have been going on for over 200 years, and many are still done the same way today. There are over a thousand jurisdictions that conduct tax sales—some every month, some just a few times a year. Every state has different rules, and even counties within the same state can have their own variations. Some cities and jurisdictions even run their own processes. It can be quite a daunting and complicated system.</p><p>I’ve noticed that, especially over the years, talking with people trying to expand their retirement portfolio or investments. There are so many things you just don’t realize. Maybe for those unfamiliar with tax liens and deeds, give us a little understanding of what that is and how the process works before we get into the details of what your company does.</strong></p><p>lifeblood of counties and jurisdictions.</strong> Every year, property owners have taxes to pay, and some fall behind. After a certain point—depending on the state—they put the property up for sale through auctions. That’s where investors like myself come in to buy either the <strong><em>‍</p><h3><strong>Especially when referring to liens—also called <strong>mandated rates of return by the state.</strong> We do a lot of that, and we also deal in tax deeds where you actually buy the property and get a deed to it.</p><p>And you guys have been doing this for a while—you know where to go and what to do.</strong></p><h3><strong>It’s a tedious process. The state gives you very little information on the property other than the legal description. You’ve got to find out everything on your own—whether it has other liens, what the physical condition is, or if the property even exists.</p><p><strong>Many examples come to mind, but there’s one famous story about a father-and-son team in Florida. They thought they were buying a beautiful, expensive home at an auction. But what they actually bought was the <em>thought</em> they owned.</p><p>Wow! I think a lot of people feel like they can just dive in without learning from the experience of others. Like you said, it’s a complex process. So help us understand—what makes tax lien and deed investing so much different than traditional real estate strategies, in terms of opportunity and risk?</strong></p><p>For example, at the last auction I attended, there were about 150 properties. I determined 75 might be decent targets, did my due diligence on those, and personally visited over 50. Then, right before the auction, many property owners paid their taxes—sometimes even on the last day—and those properties were pulled from the sale.</p><p><em>‍</p><h3><strong>Tax sales can be very lucrative if done properly. If you acquire properties at a good enough price, you can afford to pay investors 12 to 15% and still maintain profitability. You just have to be careful and disciplined.</p><p>Unlike many in this industry—where you’ve got gurus and educators selling “how-to” courses—you decided not to go that route. You handle all the due diligence and inspections for your investors instead. Why did you build your business this way, and how does it set you apart from others in the industry?</strong></p><p><strong>We start with online research, but then we visit every property in person and take our own photos. These aren’t open houses—these are potential tax sales, often occupied or vacant. We verify occupancy, assess roof and structure conditions, check electrical systems, and make a rough estimate of any needed repairs.</p><p>That level of hands-on work clearly helps reduce risk.</strong></p><h3><strong>We specialize primarily in Arkansas, Mississippi, and some parts of Texas. Those are our key markets.</p><p>Have those markets changed much recently? What’s the overall state of the marketplace right now? A lot of people wonder if the timing is right or if current conditions affect this kind of investing.</strong></p><p><strong>Most of our investors are individuals who want a steady, attractive return without the hassle. Many of them have <strong><strong>Exactly. Investing in tax sales can be a full-time job. It requires a lot of research and travel. Most people are too busy running their own lives or businesses to do that. That’s where we come in: we take on the heavy lifting so they can earn a <strong>‍</p><h3><strong>Just last week, we had a great example. I evaluated 50 properties across three different counties, went through the entire auction process, and picked up a few great deals. One of them was a <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p><p>$137,000</strong>, and although it needs some work, it’s still an incredible return.</p><p>That’s amazing. And you’re able to do that consistently because of the due diligence and systems you’ve built.</strong></p><p><strong>We focus on managing the investments directly for our clients. We’re not in the education business. There are plenty of others who offer “how-to” courses. We prefer to handle everything for our investors. That said, we’re happy to answer questions and explain how the process works for those investing with us.</p><p>Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h3><p>What would you say are some of the common mistakes investors make when they try to start doing this themselves, and how can they avoid them?</strong></p><p>That’s where trouble starts.
