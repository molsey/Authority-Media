<h2>How to Maximize Tax Deductions in Your Business with Mike Jesowshek</strong></h2><p><strong>Good, George. Thanks for having me.</p><p>Listen, man, I'm super glad to have you here because I want to talk today with the audience about a topic, which not everybody gets excited about, which is taxes, but they do get excited when they talk about things on how they can really maximize their benefits.</strong></p><p>I hit all the time that saving money is a lot easier than making money. And before we get rolling, I just wanted to let them know a little bit of your background. Mike has been a CPA, owned his own business, owned multiple companies, actually. And he's also the host of the Small Business Tax Savings Podcast and has some incredible resources for small businesses, investors, and larger businesses as they scale, for information on how to minimize and eliminate taxes.</strong></p><p>Minimize taxation, maximize deductions, and things like that. So we're going to talk about everything related to that today. But before I do, Mike, can you just give our audience a quick brushstroke of your background? Because it's not just accounting, but you're really deep in that vein. So tell us what brought you into doing your own podcast and really the business part of it, the business side of it, when you have this background in tax.</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah. It's funny, I've been an entrepreneur pretty much my whole life. So I was always working for myself but started at a young age of 14 in the online marketing industry.</p><p id="">I was in different parts of that industry—affiliate marketing, different parts of the online marketing industry. Eventually, I got to college and thought, "Okay, I'm going to go for accounting as my backup plan." I went for accounting and started a couple of businesses.</p><p>So we decided to go off and do our own things. At that point, I started a digital online accounting firm back in 2013. And now, when you say "digital accounting firm," it's a pretty common idea—especially after COVID.</p><p>The industry I was in was a younger generation, all working remotely. We had a good reputation in that industry, so it was an easy entrance for me to start that firm. We started off with bookkeeping, partnered with tax people to whom we’d send our bookkeeping clients, and really got frustrated because I could never get a clear answer from those partners.</p><p id="">I'd ask a tax planning question, like, "How would our client do this?" And they'd respond with, "It depends." I could never really get a clear answer.</p><p>The podcast started almost by accident. We were doing some YouTube videos on different tax strategies. One of our team members said, "Hey, why don’t you try putting this on a podcast?"</p><p id="">I wasn’t a podcast listener back then—this was a little over five years ago. But I thought, "Okay, let’s try it." We put three videos up, turned them into audio for a podcast.</p><p id="">Six months later, someone reached out and said, "Hey, I love your podcast. How do I work with you?" And I thought, "What podcast?" I had no clue what they were even talking about.</p><p>So we started doing weekly episodes, creating videos with accompanying blog posts, and everything like that. That’s how we started growing from there.</p><p>That’s awesome. So what’s nice about your background is you come from business into accounting, and you have the mix of both, right? You understand the day-to-day workings and the operations of growing and scaling a business, which is great.</strong></p><p><strong><strong id="">It brings up this topic that I’ve hit on a few times, and I know you’re a big advocate of distinguishing between tax preparation and tax planning, right? People think of "my accountant" and don’t realize, as they grow their wealth, they need a team of specialists. The tax code is so completely overwhelming that nobody could understand all of it anyway.</strong></p><p>You, I feel, dig deep into areas you specialize in. Help us understand from your perspective the difference between tax planning and tax prep—and the importance of each.</strong></p><p>Tax planning, on the other hand, is what you do throughout the year—January to December—to ensure you’re paying the least amount of taxes legally possible. Then, when you meet your accountant in February or March, you’re simply taking that information and submitting it to the agencies.</p><p id="">So many business owners don’t think about tax planning because they don’t get the answers they need. They might ask, "How do I hire my kids?" and get the answer, "It depends." That discourages them, and they walk away from the idea of tax planning.</p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Maximizing Deductions: Strategies and Mindset</strong></h3><p>So let’s get to the million-dollar question. Most people just want to know how to pay less taxes and maximize their deductions. I know we don’t have all the time in the world today, but where would someone start? Help us understand your mindset around maximizing deductions for businesses.</strong></p><p>For example, a traditional accountant might say, "It’s close to year-end, you should buy a truck and take some bonus depreciation." The business owner might think, "I don’t really need a truck, but if it helps with taxes, I guess I’ll get one."</p><p>When we talk about maximizing deductions, we want to shift the mindset. Instead of spending unnecessarily, we focus on how to take spending you’re already doing and turn it into pre-tax spending.</p><p>I love that distinction. It’s about turning after-tax spending into pre-tax spending. That’s a really important shift for business owners to understand. So, what are some examples or tips for how to do that?</strong></p><p>The IRS and Congress actually encourage business owners to use the tax code to their advantage. That’s one of the greatest advantages of being a business owner.</p><p>I love the way you frame that. It’s about being intentional and proactive—thinking pre-tax, not after-tax. But some business owners worry about being "too aggressive" with deductions or triggering an audit. How do you handle that concern?</strong></p><p id="">Absolutely, and it’s a common concern. Many business owners feel nervous about taking deductions, thinking it might be "shady" or risky. But the truth is, the tax code is written the way it is for a reason. It’s our job to take advantage of the opportunities it provides.</p><h3>Documentation and Compliance</strong></h3><p>So, documentation is critical. Can you give some examples of what that looks like in practice?</strong></p><p>Another great example is hiring your kids. Many business owners support their kids financially. Why not turn that into a business deduction? But it’s not as simple as just writing them a check. They need to be doing actual work, earning a reasonable wage, and you need documentation—job descriptions, employment agreements, and records of hours worked.</p><p><strong>Exactly. Reducing your tax liability doesn’t just save you money—it gives you more to invest back into your business or other opportunities. Those savings can grow and multiply over time.</p><p><strong><strong>The best place is <strong>For those who want to go deeper, we’re also launching a new software called <strong><strong>Exactly. Many of our listeners work with their existing accountants and just use our resources to bring new strategies to the table. It’s about collaboration, not replacement.</p><p>Mike, this has been such a valuable conversation. Thanks so much for being here today. And for everyone listening, share this episode with others who need to hear it. Tax planning is such a critical part of growing your business and building wealth. Take action and start planning now.
