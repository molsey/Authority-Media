<p id="">As the common saying goes, “Prevention is better than cure.” This rings true in the world of physical therapy. Joining George Wright III is Dr. Ray Waters, owner and founder of <a href="http://www.preventandrestorept.com" target="_blank">‍</p><h2><strong>I’m doing great. I’m excited to be here. </p><p>Can I call you Ray? </strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/68d5689ecde614b15d270d64_68d3afc41940e5e34c12ea28_Graphics%2520-%2520EB%2520-%2520AIP%2520S2%2520E1%2520Dr.%2520Ray%2520Waters.png" loading="lazy" alt="Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Ray Waters | Physical Therapy" width="auto" height="auto">‍</p><p>He specializes in treatment for both performance and rehab. He’s got some specialties we’re going to talk about. He has had experience treating Division I athletes, weekend warriors, desk workers, and even post-surgical patients in a lot of different things. He’s got a lot of experience. He’s very good at teaching and educating. He loves one-on-one.</strong></p><h3>‍<strong id="">He works a lot with overhead athletes, which we were talking about before the show, who are especially baseball players and people who throw, but it extends to a lot of different sports. You have an amazing background. I was amazed by how knowledgeable you are about everything. Maybe you could start by giving everybody a little bit of a background. What inspired you to get into and start your business, which is </strong><a href="https://www.preventandrestorept.com/" target="_blank">Prevent &amp; Restore Physical Therapy</strong></a><strong>Thanks for such a glowing welcome. We’ll get right into it. I’ve been very fortunate to know what I want to do for a living. That being said, from a young age of adolescence, I’ve always been into health and wellness, performance training, and strength and conditioning. I’ve always been into science and healthcare. I let that guide me a little bit.</p><p>She would take me to her PT appointments. I was like, “This is cool. This guy’s running out of a gym. He has bands and a trampoline. Does he play for a living? This is nuts.” I don’t think I realized how much schooling went into that. Long story short, my mother had some substance abuse issues that PT helped her with. To me, that was so powerful to see.</p><p><strong><strong>Education-wise, undergrad, PT school, etc. Some of the certifications are a little extra stuff. The CSES is the strength and conditioning specialist. What that allows me to do is I’m not just a regular physical therapist. I’m a strength and conditioning coach as well. As a coach, per se, I do a lot of personal training and train my clients. I have the knowledge and bandwidth to not only treat from a rehab perspective with traditional rehab, as doing your 3 sets of 10 to 12 to 15 neuromuscular control and endurance, but we work on stability with the goal of being out of pain.</p><p>I’ve had this happen before, which is sad. A patient goes from, “I’m in a lot of pain,” to, “I’m feeling a little better, but I’m not there yet.” Guess what? You’re not in enough pain to warrant more PT, so you’re dying. You’re cooked. You’re like, “I can’t return to tennis or baseball.” You’re out of enough pain for insurance to pay for. That’s why I got out of that big market, along with a lot of other reasons I can go into if we need to.</p><p class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/68d5689ecde614b15d270d6c_68c058cfe9e5f92c30a58dc2_Graphics%2520-%2520Guest%2520Square%2520-%2520AIP%2520S2%2520E1%2520Dr.%2520Ray%2520Waters.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Ray Waters | Physical Therapy" width="auto" height="auto">‍</p><p>That’s huge on the certifications. This is a core element. I tore my right bicep a while back. I’ve had some shoulder injuries and things. I know what it’s like. Having someone like yourself who comes from a background of having had injury experience and things like this helps. Having the certification, but then the application of it, like strength, conditioning, and things like that. It’s not just like a rehab. That’s good.</strong></p><h3><strong>That’s a question that keeps us all up at night at times. There have been nights when I’m working and I’m like, “What am I doing? I went from being a PT to doing this.” The biggest surprise for me was the amount of time and energy. It was the amount of energy you spend on doing things that don’t drive revenue immediately, per se.</p><p id="">Have you read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280" target="_blank">E-Myth Revisited</em></a>? It’s a very popular book.</p><p>Yeah.</strong></p><p>You’re the technician. I’m a PT. I’m a clinician. I already know how to do that. To me, that’s the easy part, in a sense. Do you have the capacity to set aside time each week to be the manager, to look in the past, and to look at what has worked and what has not worked, more importantly? Were your forecasts and predictions correct? Were these trends working?</p><p>How One-On-One Approach Works In Physical Therapy</h3><p>It’s the reason why a lot of businesses fail. They get into it for their passion. They don’t realize the heavy lifting, or they’re distracted by the heavy lifting, so they’re not successful. You want to be working with a business and a therapist who’s successful. One of the reasons why I wanted to interview you and get some content from you is that you’ve adopted this one-on-one approach.</strong></p><p>I’m curious. Before we go into some specialization, which a lot of our readers can benefit from, I want to ask you why you chose to go down that route. Even if you have a passion for it and you start a business, a lot of people get into it and think, “What’s the quickest road to make some money and pay off my loan, my debts, and things like this?” You chose a one-on-one approach versus a business. When I say that, I’m saying your time would be better spent at high volume. Give me some of your thoughts on that and why you chose that, given your profession.</strong></p><p>Patient care is best served in a one-on-one capacity.</blockquote><p>If you remember that book, one of my favorite parts that spoke out to me is the entrepreneurial seizure where you short-circuit. That was my seizure, in a sense. I could never go back to how I was prior to that. I went to management, and I was like, “I’m not proud of what I did.” I wasn’t set up for success. I couldn’t deliver to my patients. I know I can deliver, but I wasn’t set up for it. I physically couldn’t.” That ate me up.</p><p>What made you decide to make the move? I’m curious about that, and then I want to make a couple of comments about what you said. What made you decide to make the move? Was it that experience, or had you been pre-thinking about that for a while?</strong></p><p><strong>It was like, “We’re not even going to talk about a raise here. You’re throwing food at me. I come to work every day. I’ve never missed a day of work in three years, and you’re going to throw food at me.”</p><p>You’re describing a lot of people, even when they own their business sometimes, who are on this treadmill, and they’re not willing to do it. I feel like it’s so appropriate to point this out to our audience. A lot of people recognize that they’re not being fulfilled. They recognize they’re not doing their best job. They’re not unleashing their real potential, but they don’t make the decision to do it. That’s way outside your comfort zone, and the best life you have is always outside your comfort zone. Your best ability to be the best you could be for clients is not going to be something you thought about and were comfortable with, but you did it anyway.</strong></p><p><strong>Our readers here can probably appreciate and relate to this. I truly felt that the fear of resenting what you do for a living was around the corner. I knew that if I didn’t make a change, I would end up not liking or, God forbid, despising something I thought I wanted to do with my life. I was afforded an opportunity for some mentorship and work in private practice. I got away from that corporate world. I started learning the ways and how to do this private practice world, and I was like, “I can do this. I am worth this. I can make people better more quickly and get results, and I can make money doing it.”</p><blockquote><strong>Treating Professional Athletes And High-Performance Individuals</h3><p>I want to pivot because I know we don’t have a ton of time, and I have a bunch of stuff I want to ask you. I want to pivot into something else along the lines of what I asked a minute ago. Alex Hormozi talks a lot about scaling the unscalable. Most businesses start, and they think, “I've got to do it this way. There’s no way I could continue to work one-on-one.” The ultimate goal of supplying the best service for a client required that, so you decided to stay hyper-focused on doing these personalized one-on-one deals, even though it may not be scalable.</strong></p><p>What happens is in time, people start to recognize your authority and your expertise. You get paid more, and then you can go to that point. You did stay focused on that, and you went one level deeper into some specialization with athletes. I mentioned it in the intro. You talked about overhead athletes. Could you drill down a little bit into that, why you chose that, and what it is that you feel so passionate about when it comes to athletes and high performance?</strong></p><p>It’s so much fun to treat baseball, in particular. That was my first passion. My first love was the Atlanta Braves. Being in East Cobb, Marietta, a lot of people may or may not realize this, but it’s the biggest hotbed in the country for Little League Baseball. I see an opportunity in that market. I love rehabbing shoulders. That’s one of my favorite things to rehab. Treating rotational athletes and overweight athletes is very different than treating a regular person for neck or low back pain.</p><p>I was surprised to hear that there’s such a prevalence of shoulder injury in athletes, especially baseball players. Why do you think that is? With your background, help me understand why there is so much of an issue with that.</strong></p><p>The big thing is the overhead component. Softball pitchers don’t get hurt nearly that much. These softball players I see, or your third base, or your catchers who are throwing overhead, throwing and loading your arm down here is much safer, or only throwing overhead with the capacity. These kids don’t get any rest and are asked to train and play ball year-round.</p><p><strong>I take a comprehensive approach. That’s why I coined the name Prevent &amp; Restore, meaning pre-injury, prevent, restore, and post-injury, if you will.</p><p>You’re helping athletes prevent injury.</strong></p><p>Where do I spend most of my time? In a perfect world, I balance that out, but I probably spend most of my time in the rehab and the restorative part of it. I do offer a lot of functional movement screenings. I do workshops at local gyms, yoga studios, clubs, etc. I try to get out in the corporate world and do workshops about preventative techniques for my desk workers and the people who sit at a computer all day. There has been a significant rise in neck pain since COVID, not because of COVID, but because we’re sitting on our chairs all the time.</p><h3><strong><strong>I am super passionate about that. I want to backtrack and extrapolate one thing about what you said about preventative techniques. It’s super underserved. Honestly, a lot of times, insurance doesn’t pay for preventative care. It’s that simple. We don’t make money unless we’re treating you. When we’re treating you for an injury and providing patient care, it can be a patient lost. That’s why I work in this private practice. It’s not insurance-based. It’s all one-on-one and private. I can see the whole person before injury and post-injury. That’s super important.</p><p>You hit a point that I want to make sure people don’t go past. That is that a lot of times, our focus goes where things are covered, but we don’t look at the long-term consequences of that. In other words, investing in your health, your wealth, your lifestyle, your focus, preventative, daily rituals, and things like that. You don’t think about it because we’re so focused on the present and the past. We’re not focused on the future. If you think about the future, you would certainly invest in preventive measures for your health.</strong></p><p class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div id=""><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/68d5689ecde614b15d270d6f_68c0589d3f5050e8f0e309d7_Graphics%2520-%2520Host%2520Square%2520-%2520AIP%2520S2%2520E1%2520Dr.%2520Ray%2520Waters.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Authority Formula Podcast | Dr. Ray Waters | Physical Therapy" width="auto" height="auto">‍</p><p><strong>It is interesting how I got wrapped up in having a passionate interest in that. During COVID, specifically, and much after COVID, when we went and got locked down, and most people didn’t have great ergonomic setups at work, they were forced to work from home. I’ve heard horror stories of people working on a bar stool at the kitchen counter, or they’re sitting on their sofa like a shrimp, leaning over their laptop all day. Do that for eight hours a day and see how your neck and back feel.</p><p><strong>I’m going to try to take a broad stroke and not get too granular with it. There are three components of it when we think about it. There’s the thoracic spine, which is the middle of the back. How well that moves is there’s the deep neck flexor of how well the neck can hold your head up. There’s the shoulder blade and shoulder girdle strength. Those big three buckets, if you will.</p><p>The head is positioned forward in front of your shoulders. That is about 10 to 20 pounds of pressure on your disk and neck.</blockquote><p><strong>It’s crazy. People don’t realize that. I do this all the time in clinics. Every single patient I eval for neck pain, I ask what they do for a living. A lot of them work on a computer. Given they don’t have any shoulder issues, I have them hold a five-pound dumbbell right next to their side, and then I have them hold it out here. I say, “Do you feel the difference? It feels heavier, right?”</p><p><strong>That’s not that heavy. You could do 100 reps of that and hold it for 8 hours.</p><p>Your suggestions would be to get up, move around, take micro breaks, and things like that. </strong></p><p><strong>Not until it’s too late. If you think about it, it’s funny because what is your neck? It’s no different. It's muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments, and nerves. If you can train a shoulder, the lower back, or an ankle, why can’t you train your neck? No one trains their neck because no one knows how to do it and take care of themselves with preventative strategies. What do you do? You wait until it’s bothering you, and then you don’t do anything. You wait for six weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks, or two months, and you’re like, “I have a bad headache and maybe some tingling in my arm. I should go to the doctor now.”</p><h3><strong>It’s tough to answer that question and not give a negligent answer without evaluating a patient. In the 10,000-foot view, it is going to be work on mobility and work on your thoracic spine range and motion. I can’t tell you how important the thoracic spine is. Not to get too doctor speak with it, but it is in the middle of the back.</p><p>Whether you are an athlete or a desk worker, do not forget about your thoracic spine mobility.</blockquote><p>It’s the same thing with the body and the stress we put on it. If one part of your body can’t accept and attenuate the forces you’re putting on it, then that’s going somewhere else. The other part of the body doesn’t have the resume to accept that demand that you’re putting on it. That’s why mobility is the easiest thing we can all work on and train safely. I wouldn’t give advice for people to go start strengthening their neck without having a professional show them how to do that, because it’s a little bit more dangerous. You’re not going to hurt yourself. Go foam roll, please. </p><p>One of the reasons why I mentioned to you that I wanted to have you on the show is that we talk a lot about, and most people are focused on, mindset. There used to be no mindset. Mind, money, and business, we got that. The body is your vehicle for all of that. Your body will affect your mindset. It will affect your performance.</strong></p><p><strong>Get In Touch With Dr. Ray</h3><p>I know you have so much. We talked before about details, courses, and products that you’re doing for both the professional athlete, the professional CEO, and the high-level executive. What’s the best way for people to be able to get in touch with you and connect with you? What’s the easiest way for them to do that?</strong></p><p id="">The easiest way to do that is through my website. I have landing pages right there. You can visit my website at <a href="http://www.preventandrestorept.com" target="_blank"><strong>Seek Help Before Everything Is Too Late</h3><p>We touched on the idea of business. I like to combine those things, so we’ll have to talk a little bit about that. Before we take off, are there any thoughts, tips, strategies, or recommendations you have for individuals, whether it’s someone struggling with an injury or people who are dealing with pain? Any final thoughts that you might have?</strong></p><p>Go see your local PT and have them check you out, because a professional breaking down how you move is unlike anything else. You don’t know how you move. I don’t know how I move. I still go see a PT quarterly, at least. Sometimes, I go see a chiropractor. I go see people to help me analyze how I’m moving. I’m a movement expert. I help people move better for a living. At the end of the day, you don’t know how you move. You think you know how you move, but you don’t know how you move. Go get seen. Go get some expert opinion and professional guidance on that.</p><p>I love that you said that because so many times, as entrepreneurs, business owners, executives, and high-performance individuals, we are willing to invest in our wealth and in our business. Investing in your health is important. We also talk about coaches, mentors, and trainers in our business. That’s because they can see things you can’t see. The same goes for your physique, your fitness, your mindset, and your business. I appreciate it. I’m so glad I had you here.</strong></p><p>If this is your first time tuning in, I want you to do me a favor. Not only subscribe to the show, but share this episode.

Remember, and I say this at the end of all of our episodes, it’s never too late. No matter where you’re at, whether you're in pain or no pain, or whether you’re in your business and you’re growing or you’re not, it’s never too late to start creating the life that you’re meant to live. You’ve got to take action. You've got to do something about it. Thanks for being with us. I was with Dr. Ray Waters.
