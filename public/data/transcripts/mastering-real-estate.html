<h1>Mastering Real Estate with Candice Amundson: Balancing Adventure, Business, and Family</strong></h1><p><strong>I’m good. Thanks for having me.</p><p>Yeah, listen, I want to give a little background on you, but for those tuning in, our goal is always to give you that daily dose of inspiration and education. More importantly, I want to share techniques, strategies, and tactics that you can use, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do today.</strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Yeah, absolutely. I was born and raised in Minnesota. I’ve always been into outdoor activities—hiking, biking, canoeing, and winter sports—so naturally, I love to travel and explore. That passion for travel led me to real estate.</p><p>Recently, I’ve expanded beyond Minnesota, helping people across the U.S. understand what it takes to succeed in the hospitality business. I think my adventurous spirit has naturally played a role in shaping my approach to real estate.</p><p>Yeah, so your passion for adventure led you into this niche. That’s awesome.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>I would say scheduling everything—including non-negotiables—and treating them as appointments.</p><p>Next, I color-coordinate my schedule so that I’m doing the most important tasks when I have the best energy—usually in the morning. That’s when I handle lead generation, follow-ups, and other high-value activities.</p><p><strong><strong>‍</p><h3>The Art of Networking and Connecting</strong></h3><p>Now, you’re known as a connector, right? There are a lot of people who network, but you take it to another level. Can you share how you’ve turned that skill into income? Because I know a lot of people who are great at networking and have strong relationships, but they struggle to monetize it. How have you been able to turn that into passive income and business growth?</strong></p><p>Sometimes, these people have completely different strengths than I do. Other times, they have a creative mindset that complements my own. Once that relationship is established, opportunities naturally arise—whether through real estate investments, referrals, or other collaborations.</p><p>It’s really about continuously finding great partners—whether through podcasts, social media, or industry events—and fostering those relationships.</p><p>Yeah, and you do a phenomenal job at that. I want to highlight something you said because I always tell our listeners that success leaves clues. You mentioned a key word—‘attract.’ You attract opportunities through relationships, rather than just chasing them.</strong></p><p>A lot of people understand that relationships are important, but the ability to attract opportunities through those relationships is what sets you apart. That’s something people need to pay attention to.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>One of the biggest misconceptions is around zoning and regulations. Many people don’t fully understand what they can and can’t do in a particular market—or how to pivot if new regulations are introduced.</p><p>Another example is Duluth, Minnesota. It’s a well-known vacation market, but there are very few permits available, and there’s often a waitlist to get one. Even though it’s a high-revenue market, the restrictions make it difficult to enter.</p><p><strong>Yes, my biggest piece of advice is to use multiple data sources—never rely on just one.</p><p>InvestTR by Vrolio</strong>, which provides mid-term and short-term rental data. Another great tool is <strong>The key thing to remember is that <strong><strong>‍</p><h3>Unique and Profitable Rental Strategies</strong></h3><p>If someone is looking to enter the vacation rental market, do you have a go-to strategy that can work anywhere?</strong></p><p>That could mean investing in a uniquely shaped property, like a tiny home or an A-frame, or adding amenities that stand out. A lot of properties have common features like hot tubs and saunas, but you can go beyond that by offering something unexpected.</p><p>Another idea is to create a “hidden” feature—maybe a secret door that leads to a home theater or a themed space. Anything that keeps guests engaged and talking about your property will give you an edge over the competition.</p><p><strong><strong>‍</p><h3>When to Choose a Mid-Term Rental Over a Short-Term Rental</strong></h3><p>If you’re comfortable with a strategy that requires less day-to-day management but still earns more than a long-term lease, mid-term rentals are a great option.</p><p>Other factors to consider include:</p><ul><strong><strong><strong>The key is to understand the <strong><strong>‍</p><h3>Emerging Trends in Vacation Rentals</strong></h3><p>uniqueness</strong> is a huge trend right now. There’s been a rise in boutique hotels and highly themed, experience-driven properties.</p><p>maximalist design</strong>.</p><p>What is that? I haven’t heard of it.</strong></p><p>The Dollhouse</strong>. It has leopard print spiral staircases, zebra stairs, neon lights—just really eclectic and vintage.</p><p>Another trend is <strong><strong>‍</p><h3>Leveraging Digital Marketing to Increase Bookings</strong></h3><p>That ties perfectly into influencer marketing and social media. Have you used digital marketing strategies to increase bookings and revenue?</strong></p><p>engage with social media communities</strong>—whether that’s Facebook groups, Instagram, or other platforms.</p><p>providing value</strong>—sharing insights, answering questions, and connecting with like-minded people. That kind of engagement naturally leads to opportunities.</p><p>Yeah, and you probably see this as much as I do—people are often afraid to put themselves out there. But the tipping point comes when they realize the power of being authentic.</strong></p><p>As a marketer, I’ve seen it time and time again. The polished, studio-shot content rarely performs as well as an iPhone video where you’re just being yourself. Have you noticed that too?</strong></p><p><strong>Oh no, not at all. In the beginning, I wouldn’t do anything because I was too focused on making everything perfect—the backdrop, the sound, the lighting. It was rocky at first.</p><p><strong><strong>Yeah, absolutely. I’ve had my share of adversity, and I’ve learned that you can look at challenges in two ways: You can see yourself as a victim, or you can ask, “Why is this happening for me?”</p><p>for</strong> me—not <strong>One of the biggest things to come out of my journey is <strong>Originally, I envisioned a separate shelter just for pets, but it actually turned out even better. Now, survivors can bring their pets with them and keep them in their rooms, providing emotional support and healing.</p><p>why</strong> I went through those experiences.</p><p><strong><strong>for</em> you, not <em><strong>Yeah, absolutely. When your life and work align with your purpose, that’s when you feel truly successful. It’s not just about making money—it’s about making an impact.</p><p><strong><strong>Honestly, it’s seeing people take my advice, apply it, and get results.</p><p>No one else can share that excitement like we can in that moment. It’s something special.</p><p>Yeah, it’s the realization of both their dream and yours. That’s powerful.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Right now, I’m looking for a short-term rental in <strong>The goal is to make it a unique, experiential property that I can also use for <strong>see the process in action</strong>.</p><p>own 10 short-term rentals this year</strong>, so I’m actively searching in certain markets.</p><p>I love that. You should document that journey—not just as a case study but as a behind-the-scenes process. People would get a ton of value from seeing how you do it step by step.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Advice for New Real Estate Investors</strong></h3><p>Let’s say someone is just starting their real estate investing journey. What’s one key piece of advice you’d give them?</strong></p><p><li>Learn from credible sources.</strong> Not everyone giving advice knows what they’re talking about. Find someone who’s actually done it—someone who is succeeding at a high level.</li><li>Connect with local experts.</strong> Real estate is heavily influenced by local trends, regulations, and market conditions. A knowledgeable local mentor can help you avoid costly mistakes.</li><li>Do your market research.</strong> Before jumping into a new market, ask: <br><ul>What’s the <strong>What’s the <strong><strong><strong>I normally don’t do this, but for this podcast, I’ll share my <strong>30-minute discovery call</strong>, they can use the link in the show notes.</p><p>That’s awesome!
