<h2>‍</p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast George Wright III here. I'm joined by a great topic. This is going to be really fun.</strong></p><p>I'm joined by Spencer Howard, and I'm going to give you a quick background on him. He's a credit card loyalty and travel reward expert. He's the founder of a company called Straight to the Points, and he teaches strategies behind how to use your business card to create a luxury travel lifestyle.</strong></p><p>But he's been a travel writer and editor for over a decade, featured on podcasts and outlets. What I loved about when I saw his background is he travels three months per year to 60-plus countries. So welcome to the podcast, Spencer. How are you?</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Spencer Howard's Background and Journey</strong></h3><p>So tell us a little bit about your story. I'm curious about your background, but more importantly, what settled you into this niche of luxury travel?</strong></p><p>I thought, “I’m six-three. I’d love to lie down.” I think I had just booked a flight to Japan in economy, and my knees were going to be in the back of the seat in front of me. I needed to do this better. That was the jumping-off point for me.</p><p>Had you been traveling already? Your whole life? Or not really?</strong></p><p>I spent four hours a night for six months learning everything you could never want to know about airline programs and credit card fine print. Now I basically just say, “You don’t need to do that. I’ll do it for you.”</p><p>That’s awesome. And this is credit card travel, but you’ve been blogging and writing. Was that writing and blogging in this particular topic that you were learning, studying, and growing on?</strong></p><h3>Turning Passion into a Business</strong></h3><p>At what point did this turn from an interest to a business for you? What made you decide, “I like this. I want to make this a business”? Because at the end of the day, I’m sure a lot of people are like, “There’s a lot of things I’d like to do; I’m going to study them, really get into them, maybe even write—but how do I monetize it?” So, at what point did it turn into a business, and did you see initially that there was an opportunity with it? Or was it just, “I think I can do this, and I want to focus my time on it”?</strong></p><p>I think I was looking for a flight and noticed something rare—an opportunity to use points for a business class flight. I mentioned it to a friend of mine. I said, “I do all this research for the articles I’m writing. I should just send emails out when I find something worth booking.” He was like, “Do it right now. I’ll sign up. Do it.”</p><p><strong><strong>Yeah, it’s funny because I remember in 2018 hearing people say, “Oh, email newsletters are dead.” I thought, “Okay, that’s fine. I like blogging.” This felt a bit more curated. I’m only going to talk to people who are interested in what I’m interested in.</p><p><strong><strong>Yeah, for me, it started because I love flying. If I can make the journey fun, that seemed like an awesome way to do it. This is just what I cared about and what I was interested in doing.</p><p>That’s what mattered to me. Not everyone cares about that, and that’s great, but this is my little circle.</p><p>And you and I talked a little bit about this. Not everybody believes they can do it. I think many don’t believe they could ever afford it or have enough money on their credit card to make it happen. Plus, I don’t think they know where to start or even if it’s possible. Have you run into that? What do you say to someone who doesn’t think it’s possible?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah, I think, especially with points and credit cards, people often see credit cards as dangerous. I’ll readily admit they can be, but only if you’re not in a good financial position or not responsible with your finances.</p><p>That’s fine. I just don’t want anyone to experience financial hardship because they decided to play a game. In the end, this is a game. It’s fun.</p><p><strong>It’s not a game for winging it. You can be spontaneous with it—book a last-minute trip when you find a ticket you can book with points. That’s fun. I’ve booked a flight six hours before departure and gone to Europe.</p><p><strong>If you’re spending around $1,000 to $1,500 a month, you can probably do something meaningful. But it all comes down to your level of interest.</p><p>Then, there’s the “add-on” approach, where you start with four to six credit cards and supplement with a new one every few months.</p><p><strong>My main focus is on transferable or flexible points. Banks like Chase, Amex, Citi, Capital One, and Bilt have programs where you can transfer points to partner airlines or hotels.</p><p>Got it. So transferable points open up more options and flexibility compared to sticking with just one airline or hotel chain? That makes sense. Explain a little more about why transferable points are such a great strategy.</strong></p><p>But with transferable points—say, Chase Ultimate Rewards—you can transfer your points to British Airways, which is a OneWorld partner like American. Or you could transfer them to Air Canada’s Aeroplan program, which is a Star Alliance member, or to Air France/KLM’s Flying Blue program, which is part of SkyTeam.</p><p><strong>Exactly! And here’s another example to illustrate the value of transferable points. Let’s say you’re booking a one-way business-class ticket to Europe. If you use Flying Blue (Air France/KLM’s program), it might cost you 50,000 miles and a couple of hundred dollars in taxes and fees.</p><p>By using transferable points, you can pick the program that gives you the best value for the flight you want.</p><p>That’s a game-changer. I’ve definitely run into the frustration of limited award space with certain airlines, so having options is critical. How do you help clients avoid that frustration?</strong></p><p>For example, let’s say I’m flying from DC to Europe. If there’s no award space on United or its Star Alliance partners, I could check Air France/KLM through Flying Blue or even British Airways.</p><p><strong>It can feel overwhelming at first, but that’s why I focus on simplifying it. I have a quick-start guide on my website to help people understand the basics. Once you know the foundational principles—like which airlines partner with which programs—it becomes much easier.</p><p>Having someone curate this information for you saves a ton of time and energy.</p><p><strong><strong>One of the biggest misconceptions is that having multiple credit cards will ruin your credit score. In reality, if you’re managing your cards responsibly—paying your balances in full and on time—it can actually improve your credit score.</p><p>The key is to change your mindset. Instead of thinking, “I can’t afford this,” think, “How can I make this work?”</p><p>That’s such a good point. It’s all about mindset and strategy. I love that you make this accessible for people, whether they’re casual travelers or hardcore points enthusiasts. What’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone just starting out?</strong></p><p>And don’t feel like you have to master everything overnight. Just focus on understanding the basics, and as you gain experience, you’ll start to see how everything fits together.</p><p><strong><strong>Absolutely! The best place to start is my website,<a href="https://straighttothepoints.co">If you’re interested in more hands-on help, I also offer a paid newsletter where I send out curated award space opportunities and tips for maximizing your points.</p><p>Perfect. I’ll make sure to include all those links in the show notes so our listeners can easily find you. Thanks again, Spencer. This has been an amazing conversation, and I can’t wait to share it with everyone.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><p><strong>Spencer has been a guest speaker in multiple shows on YouTube touching on maximizing points – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWVNVBjTHuI" target="_blank" id="">Geobreeze</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0duNtorfug" target="_blank" id="">Waller’s Wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX5Iz8Zlxjc" target="_blank" id="">Every Passport Stamp</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTO7FmV-BiQ" target="_blank" id="">Miles Talk.</a> In addition, Spencer has been on multiple podcasts such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R0xlh08enWXAMFbkv2T2h?si=930615ecdfed4f50&nd=1" target="_blank" id="">Beyond The Lens podcast</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4MYSVOtRiLPKWhbsiu8RYb?si=71ff3ca365a9466d" target="_blank" id="">Miles to Memories</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0yOJBA15yiZyxMLOchSTIe?si=e1dd550962fa46d4" target="_blank" id="">Saverocity Observation Deck</a> where Spencer discussed airline cancellation policies, award trends, and more.
