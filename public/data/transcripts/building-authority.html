<h2>Greg Anderson: Tech for Impactful Community</strong></h2><p><strong><strong><strong>I’m fantastic today. It’s good to be here. It’s always nice to hear somebody say something about you, especially when you’re like, "Oh yeah, I have done that. Oh yeah." Because sometimes we just forget. As entrepreneurs, you just bulldoze through and keep working. Then you look back and realize, wow, there’s a pretty cool list of things we’ve accomplished so far.</p><p>I know. I was thinking just in the last year—gosh, we’ve had you featured in several of our magazines. You’ve been involved when we had Neil Patel, one of the best marketers in the world, on the cover. You’ve got businesses moving, but our conversations go everywhere from mindset and mental health to business and strategy.</strong></p><p>Today, I’ll try my best to keep us focused just a little bit for everyone listening. Do me a favor—give us a little bit about yourself and maybe what’s led you to your current passion around Jedari. For people who don’t know you, share a bit of your background.</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah, for sure. You know, it’s a great conversation because even now, I’m learning more about myself all the time. I grew up in Utah, dyslexic, and in resource classes for everything—math, social studies, English. Originally, I always looked at that as a bad thing. My high school guidance counselor told me, "Hey, Greg, labor for construction is a good career. Don’t think about college."</p><p>So, I grew up feeling like an outsider. Flash forward 20 years—after education, personal development, NLPs, Tony Robbins seminars, and all kinds of learning—I realized that this was actually my superpower. The fact that I wasn’t classically trained on how to put things in boxes, or how those boxes should even exist, meant I got to figure it out for myself. That, and maybe a high degree of Asperger’s, because I rank on that chart and get pretty intense about some things.</p><p>And the same applies to business. If you’re in business and you’re not looking at your math and money, your system is failing.</p><p>I love that because I think most people who work around me see how I’ve evolved—not just in my personal life, but in business too. Once you start recognizing systems, blueprints, and the way you think and act, you realize how everything connects. The marketplace is no exception.</strong></p><p>That’s one reason I think you’ve done so well—you’ve evolved how you do things over time. More and more, I think people are becoming holistic, which is why, with our mastermind community, we focus on mind, body, money, and business to create a lifestyle. It’s not just about making a lot of money.</strong></p><p>I’m curious—recently, you and I talked about how our mastermind and podcast focus on building authority. I’d like to go down this road and talk about content and community. You’ve built massive communities and worked with some of the biggest leaders. What can businesses do, and how should they think about content? I think your perspective is critical for people.</strong></p><p><strong>I love it. To set it up and dive deeper, content as a business blankets a lot of things. But it’s also one of the most sought-after business models right now. Private equity firms, venture capitalists, and family offices are all looking for businesses with content attached to them.</p><p>Not everyone recognizes this, but the marketplace is shifting. Social media exploded because people gave content away for free. It made platforms like Facebook and Instagram successful. But now, businesses realize that maybe they don’t want to give everything away for free on platforms that market to their audience all the time. Maybe they want to pull that content into a private world they control—through a community app, learning management system, or another tool.</p><h3>Monetizing Content and Creating Private Communities</strong></h3><p>I want to talk a little more about that. But first, let’s break it down for some of the people listening. As the marketplace shifts and evolves, like you said, whether it’s product development, personal growth, or business strategy, recognizing the value of content is critical.</strong></p><p>You mentioned that private equity, banks, and others value content because it levels the playing field. Small businesses now have something unique to differentiate themselves. Can you explain why it’s important to contain content and build private communities rather than just posting everything on free platforms?</strong></p><p id="">If we think of free social media as the "intrigue" step in sales, it makes sense. In sales, you have to do three things: get someone interested in your product, convert their mindset to see its value, and finally, complete the sale. Social media is primarily about intrigue. It’s designed to spark interest in what you offer.</p><p>There’s also a practical reason for this. Some industries, like medicine or law, face restrictions on what they can post publicly. For example, a stem cell doctor might want to share the latest research but would risk being shut down by the FDA if it’s on a public platform. However, in a private community, they can freely share that information with their audience.</p><p>So what you’re saying is that businesses need to move beyond just creating value through content. They need to control their content, create exclusivity, and provide a dedicated environment where their audience can engage with them directly.</strong></p><p>When you create a private environment, you have full control. You’re not only protecting your audience but also delivering a more tailored experience. You can livestream, deliver content, host discussions, and gather feedback—all within your branded ecosystem. This gives you freedom, control, and the ability to directly influence your audience without distractions.</p><p><strong><strong>Great question. Anyone with a product or service has something to offer, whether they realize it or not. There are really two avenues to start with: time or money.</p><p>The second avenue is using paid ads. You can pay to get in front of your audience by buying ad space or partnering with influencers. Over time, most businesses find a balance between the two. They create content organically and supplement it with paid campaigns.</p><p><strong>Absolutely. One of the greatest marketers of all time, Dan Kennedy, said, "If you’re not becoming a celebrity in your niche, you’re underutilizing your potential." Personal branding is about building authority in your space, and that authority attracts opportunities you can’t plan for.</p><p><strong>Over the years, I’ve built various software platforms—some focused on making money, others designed purely for bringing people together. Eventually, I started creating hybrids that could do both.</p><p>This approach solves several problems. First, it keeps your audience focused on your brand. Second, it ensures their data isn’t shared with third parties. And finally, it gives you complete control over the user experience.</p><p><strong><strong>Exactly. Think about it: You could upload a great YouTube video, but as soon as it ends, viewers are shown other people’s content. Or you might have ads running on top of your work. It dilutes your message. By creating a private environment, you remove those distractions and provide a more intentional experience for your audience.</p><h3>The Importance of Passion, Purpose, and Mindset</strong></h3><p>I wanted to shift gears again because, Greg, you’re not just driven by business and technology. You’ve been incredibly successful in those areas, but I know you’re also passionate about the human experience—about evolving into the best version of yourself. That’s something I admire about you. Can you talk about why passion, purpose, and mindset are so important to you?</strong></p><p>To make a positive impact on the world, I believe it’s my job to evolve, to grow, and to experience life fully. And let’s be real—becoming wealthy is a part of that. When you’re financially secure, you can make a bigger impact. You can help others, fund initiatives, and create change. But the foundation for all of that is being healthy—mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.</p><p><strong>Exactly. One of the key drivers behind Jedari was creating a platform where people could control their own narrative. I wanted a space where people could communicate freely, as long as they weren’t breaking laws, and share ideas without interference. Communication is how we solve problems, grow, and make an impact.</p><p><strong><strong>Valiant CEO</em>. You talked about the idea of “disrupting your success.” I think that resonates with a lot of people at the top of their game who feel like something’s missing. Can you elaborate on that?</strong></p><p>In my own life, there was a point where I thought I had it all. I was making great money, had the cars, the lifestyle—but I wasn’t happy. So, I stripped everything down. I left the country, went nomadic, and spent time focusing on what really mattered. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend going that extreme, but I do think it’s important to reassess and work on the areas you’ve been neglecting.</p><p><strong>I’d love that too. Rebuilding isn’t just about fixing what’s broken; it’s about evolving. Whether it’s your business, your systems, or yourself, there’s always room for growth. And the exciting part is, when you approach it with the right mindset, the possibilities are endless.</p><p><strong><strong>For me personally, it’s Instagram or Facebook. My handle on both is Greg W. Anderson. If you’re curious about the technology I’m working on, or if you think Jedari might be a good fit for your business, you can visit Jedari.com. That’s J-E-D-A-R-I. The name is inspired by the idea of Jedi-level technology combined with the elegance of Armani—because I’m a little crazy like that.</p><p>That’s the first time you’ve told me what the name means! I love it. That’s amazing.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>‍</p><p>‍<strong>Greg Anderson is a visionary system architect, entrepreneur, and thought leader known for transforming complex challenges into streamlined solutions.
