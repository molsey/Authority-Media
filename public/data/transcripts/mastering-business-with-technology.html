<h2>Mastering Business with Technology with Jamie Gilleland</strong></h2><p>‍</strong></p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast. </strong></p><p>I’m joined by an amazing guest today. This interview is going to be a little different—we’re going to dig into some strategies as well as background. I want to introduce you to Jamie and give you a little bit of her background before we dive in.</strong></p><p>She’s a world-class business leader—a speaker, coach, and elite business development expert. Jamie has two decades of experience driving business innovation. She’s been the co-founder of Market Area Real Estate Services Franchise, one of Market Magazine’s Top 100 Franchise Concepts.</strong></p><p>Between her elite knowledge of Infusionsoft (now Keap) and her ability to partner with industry giants, she has a wealth of expertise. Currently, she’s the CEO of Riff Social, helping clients harness the power of automation and social media ads for sales and marketing. Jamie, I’m thrilled to have you here today.</strong></p><h3>The Journey to Business and Marketing</strong></h3><p>I know we’ve crossed paths over the years, and it’s clear to me that you know your stuff when it comes to business. For those who might not know your background, what got you into the business and marketing world? Were you always an entrepreneur, or did you gradually find your way into it?</strong></p><p>And I earned my master’s degree in Marketing.</p><p>That’s an incredible combination.</strong></p><p><strong>Before the internet even existed, I was in Washington, DC, selling hardware and software. I sold IBMs and Compaq computers to government contractors. We called them the Beltway Bandits.</p><p><strong>After 9/11, I was in the DC area, and my daughter’s school started planning for potential attacks. They were asking for supplies to quarantine the kids in case of emergencies. I thought, “No way. I want out of this rat race.”</p><p>He brought me on as a consultant and later made me COO, and eventually, CEO of the franchise corporation. I wrote the franchise documents, built the business, and we even had a $3 million IPO on Wall Street.</p><h3>Overcoming Challenges</strong></h3><p>Wow. That must have been an incredibly difficult time. How did you process that diagnosis? You were on a successful trajectory, and then suddenly, your life changed. What was your mindset during that period?</strong></p><p>He told me surgery was my only option, but with the size of my tumor, I had less than a 20% chance of surviving. He suggested I get my affairs in order and enjoy my last months.</p><p><strong>He said, “There is no option C.” And I replied, “Sure there is. You’re going to do the surgery, I’m going to survive, and I’m going to see my kids grow up and get married.”</p><p><strong>Absolutely. When I had to step away from the business, even though I’d written the franchise manual, we hadn’t put systems in place for running the corporate headquarters. It was 2007, and real estate was crashing. The business failed while I was out.</p><p><strong>Yes, exactly. I started in web design and building systems. Infusionsoft kept trying to recruit me to promote their product, but at the time, it was $400 a month. I thought, “My small-business clients won’t spend that.”</p><h3>Selling Results, Not Products</strong></h3><p>It sounds like that was a turning point for you. You started creating systems not just for yourself but also for your clients. What did you find was the biggest struggle for entrepreneurs when it came to adopting automation tools like Keap?</strong></p><p>I looked at him and said, “Scott, I don’t sell Keap.” His face dropped—he probably thought, “Why am I interviewing her?”</p><p><strong>Exactly. People don’t buy products; they buy outcomes. They don’t care if it’s Keap, Salesforce, or something else. As long as it delivers the result they’re looking for, that’s what matters.</p><p>That’s a great philosophy. Let’s pivot to what you’re doing now. You’ve had incredible success with automation and Keap, but you’ve recently taken on the role of CEO at Riff Social. What led you to make that move?</strong></p><p>When I met Bill Hillestad, Riff Social’s visionary founder, he showed me how we could use automation and AI to make social media ads accessible and effective.</p><p><strong>We use AI in conjunction with Meta’s algorithm to find the perfect audience. Instead of telling Facebook who we think should see your content, we let the content itself attract the right people.</p><p><li>Video Validation Ads</strong> – These drive 5,000–10,000 views to your post immediately, building credibility and authority.</li><li>Targeted Ads</strong> – These show your post to the ideal audience, ensuring you’re reaching people who are likely to engage.</li></ol><h3>Building Authority Through Consistency</strong></h3><p>That’s such a smart strategy—focusing on validation and targeting. How quickly can businesses start seeing results with Riff Social? Is it a long-term process like traditional organic growth?</strong></p><p>Of course, building trust and authority takes multiple touches. In today’s noisy market, you need 15–30 interactions to really connect with your audience. That’s why we retarget engaged users, ensuring they see your content consistently.</p><p><strong>Video content generates more engagement than static posts. When people see a video with thousands of views, it validates your authority and makes them more likely to watch.</p><p>By using our system, your posts gain immediate credibility, and that drives more engagement from your target audience.</p><p>This approach seems like a game changer for small businesses. Many entrepreneurs struggle with time and resources. How does automation help them overcome these challenges?</strong></p><p>With Riff Social, you just create your content, and we handle the rest. We automate the ads, audience targeting, and retargeting so you can focus on what you do best—running your business.</p><p>For someone new to social media marketing, where should they start? Should they focus on creating content, learning about ads, or diving straight into automation?</strong></p><p>Once you’ve got a few posts, schedule a call with us. We’ll help you build a strategy and show you how Riff Social can amplify your reach.</p><p><strong>Absolutely! If you’ve already been posting, especially videos, we’ll run a free campaign for one of your posts. We’ll drive 5,000–10,000 views so you can see the power of Riff Social in action.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>That’s such a generous offer, Jamie. Before we wrap up, do you have any final advice for our listeners?</strong></p><p>As Bill Hillestad likes to say, “Shut up and post. We’ll take care of the rest.”</p><p>Jamie, thank you so much for joining us today. Your insights have been invaluable, and I know our listeners will get so much value from this episode.
