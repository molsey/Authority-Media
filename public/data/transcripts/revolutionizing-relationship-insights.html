<h2>James Pizzola: Modern Relationship Insights</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Welcome back to <em>Valiant CEO Magazine</em>. He’s someone who is truly an innovator, and his name is James Pizzola.</strong></p><p>James Pizzola is a visionary leader and the CEO of a brand-new mobile app we’re going to discuss today. With over 10 years of experience in business strategy, leadership, and project management, he has a proven track record of driving growth, innovation, and success. But what really sets him apart is his passion for improving relationships, which inspired him to create this app.</strong></p><p>The app is designed to help people navigate their relationships more effectively and make informed, data-driven decisions. Today, he’ll share with us his entrepreneurial journey, his perspective on authority, and his insights into relationships.</strong></p><p>James, welcome to the show, man!</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>James Pizzola's Background and Vision</strong></h3><p>So why don’t you do me a favor and give me kind of a backdrop for our listeners? Where do you come from? What’s your key skill set? And then we’ll bridge over into where you’re headed now. Give us a bit of your background.</strong></p><p>I wanted to take that passion and blend it with the skills I’ve developed in the IT world to create something that many people could benefit from.</p><p>I love that. What really excited me about having you on the show is that I’m a pretty analytical guy, too. Even though I teach and explore personal development and mindset, I’m still very analytical. I think a lot of people resonate with that.</strong></p><p>Having an engineering, detail-oriented background and then merging it with personal development—quite honestly, that’s why I started <em><strong>That’s a great question, and I appreciate you asking. Like I mentioned, I’ve always been interested in why people do the things they do. Most of us are trying to make rational decisions in the moment with the information we have, but that can become difficult when emotions are running high.</p><p>I reached a point where I wanted to evaluate whether the relationship was still a net positive for me. Like many people in romantic, familial, or platonic relationships, I found it hard to separate emotions from rational, logical thinking. Friends might give advice, saying, “Is this relationship worth it for you?” But ultimately, you have to make that decision yourself.</p><p>That’s why I developed this app. It helps users track their interactions and gather data on their relationships. This way, they can look back with clarity to see how they were feeling at specific times. More importantly, they can identify trends to determine whether the relationship is one to continue pursuing or whether there are issues that need to be addressed proactively before they spiral into negativity.</p><p>Man, I love that. I really do. And I want to dive into how you were able to translate these insights into technical terms. But before we do, let me ask this foundational question: Relationships are essential in both business and life.</strong></p><p>The quality of your life is directly tied to your relationships, but most people agree relationships can feel ambiguous. They’re emotionally driven, not logical. So how do you measure something like that? Is it about measuring it, or is it about having indicators? Are there always going to be intangible elements? Or is the goal to provide a guidepost to help people navigate relationships better?</strong></p><p><strong>That’s a great question. There are a lot of nuances in relationships. What our app does is give users the opportunity to record various interactions they have.</p><p>Let’s say you went grocery shopping with your partner. That’s a low-significance activity, but if you had a nice time, you might rate it a 7 out of 10. Conversely, if you had a heated argument about an important topic—like deciding where to live—that would be a high-significance interaction. If it didn’t go well, you might rate it a 3 out of 10.</p><p>More importantly, it provides clarity. If things aren’t going well, you can assess whether the relationship is still beneficial for both parties or whether adjustments are needed to improve it.</p><p>I love that. It’s so interesting because I’ve been having conversations lately that align with what you’re saying. For our listeners, I want to double down on what you just mentioned. Relationships are one of our most valuable assets. They shape our lives just as much as our thoughts do.</strong></p><p>And I’ve often said that what you focus on grows, and what you measure improves. Your app lets people focus on their relationships and track them in a way that helps them grow and improve. It reminds me of something Brendan Burchard talks about—rating your life every day to see if you’re improving or not.</strong></p><p>So, this app doesn’t just measure interactions; it helps people focus on them and take them to the next level. Would you agree with that?</strong></p><p>This is why so many people go back to their exes. You convince yourself it wasn’t as bad as it felt at the time. But our app allows you to look back objectively at how you felt during specific moments in the relationship.</p><p><strong><strong>Our app is designed for anyone who values relationships, which should ideally be everyone. But we’re particularly targeting people who want to improve the quality of their relationships—whether romantic, familial, or platonic.</p><p><li>Download the app:</strong> You can find it in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</li><li>Set up your profile:</strong> Enter your details and start adding the key relationships in your life. This process takes about 30 to 45 seconds per relationship.</li><li>Log interactions:</strong> After any significant interaction—like going on a date, attending a family event, or having a discussion—you can log it in the app.</li><li>Rate and analyze:</strong> Rate the interaction’s significance and outcome. Over time, the app will track patterns and trends in your relationships.</li></ol><p>This gives therapists better insights into your dynamics, allowing them to provide more tailored guidance. It’s like a fitness tracker for your emotional health. Even if you don’t have a therapist, the app helps you analyze your relationships and identify areas for improvement.</p><p>Got it. That’s a brilliant analogy—like a fitness tracker for relationships. And it’s so valuable because the more objective data we have, the better decisions we can make.</strong></p><p>But what I find fascinating is how this ties back to personal development. Relationships are crucial, but the relationship we have with ourselves is just as important. Are you incorporating that into the app as well?</strong></p><p>These assessments include:</p><ul><strong><strong><strong>One exciting feature we’re working on is integrating the Big Five personality test and Carl Jung’s brand archetype assessment. These tools will help users identify what types of people they align with and what types they may struggle with.</p><h3>Personal Development and Relationships</strong></h3><p>I love that. It’s so true. The relationship we have with ourselves impacts everything—our philosophy, how we approach relationships, and even how we filter experiences.</strong></p><p>Starting with self-awareness and building outward to external relationships is so powerful. I think what you’re doing is dynamite. I’m excited to see how this develops. But let me ask you this—what motivated you to take this path? Is it about having an impact on the world, or is this something more personal for you?</strong></p><p>During COVID, I realized just how essential relationships are. For many of us, it was a very isolating time. If you were lucky enough to have someone with you, that was great. But for those who didn’t, it was incredibly lonely.</p><p>Coming out of a relationship that didn’t work out also fueled my drive. I spent a lot of time processing what went wrong and asking myself whether something like this app could have helped us stay on track. Could we have recognized the issues earlier and addressed them before they became unmanageable?</p><p>That’s a powerful motivator. And you mentioned something earlier that really struck me: people often move from one bad relationship to another because they don’t fully understand themselves. Is that something you’re addressing with the assessments you’re building?</strong></p><p>The assessments we’re developing are designed to help users better understand themselves—things like their relationship style, personality type, and interests. For example, Carl Jung’s archetypes help identify compatibility with others.</p><p><strong>Exactly. And that’s the goal—to create tools that empower people to improve their lives from the inside out. When you feel confident in who you are and understand what works for you, it has a positive impact on everything.</p><p>Man, I love this. We could probably talk for hours on this topic. But let me shift gears for a moment. A lot of business owners listen to this show, and they’re always looking for insights to grow their businesses.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>I think it’s twofold. First, I’ll draw from Jeff Bezos. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on an excellent customer experience, and I couldn’t agree more.</p><p><strong>The second is something I’ve learned from Elon Musk. He focuses on identifying and solving the single biggest problem or bottleneck facing his companies.</p><p>Smaller issues can be delegated to the team, but as the CEO, your responsibility is to tackle the most challenging problems. Whether it’s a technical bug, a marketing challenge, or a strategic pivot, addressing that one major roadblock can create momentum for the entire organization.</p><p>That’s a powerful mindset. Working on the business rather than in the business is key to long-term growth. And focusing on solving the biggest bottleneck helps prioritize your energy where it matters most. It’s a game-changer for CEOs and entrepreneurs alike.</strong></p><p><strong>Sure! You can visit our website at <strong>We’re offering a free 30-day trial to all users, including therapists. After that, it’s a subscription-based service. But we want people to have the chance to try it out, integrate it into their relationships, and see the value it brings.</p><p>That’s great.
