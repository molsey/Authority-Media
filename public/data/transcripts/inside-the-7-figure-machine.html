<h2>Dr. Noah St. John on Building 7-Figure Success</strong></h2><p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Seven Figure Machine: The Ultimate Roadmap to Endless Earnings and Financial Freedom.</em> So welcome to the show, Noah. How are you?</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Noah St. John's Background Story</strong></h3><p>You hear motivational speakers, they'll get on stage all the time, they'll say, "We were poor, but we were happy. We didn’t know we were poor." In my family, we freaking knew we were poor. My mother, bless her heart, reminded us every day that we were poor and miserable. So no, it wasn’t happy—it sucked.</p><p>Because I saw that right down the street, there was great wealth and abundance. So I said from the time I was a little kid, "How the heck can I get from here to there?" Of course, there was no one who could help me. There was no internet back then, none of the things we have today. So I did the only thing I could think of—I went to the library and read every book in the self-help section.</p><p>At the very last moment, my life was spared, but I didn’t know why. So I said, "I’ve got to find out what my purpose is here on Earth. Why am I here?" These are questions humans have been asking for centuries. I didn’t know how to answer that question, so I said, "Okay, I’ve got to go back to the library." I did. This time, I read every book in the spiritual section and studied that. I just immersed myself in that literature.</p><p><strong>Then fast forward five years later, in 1997, I had these epiphanies when I realized exactly what was missing in all those books and all those seminars I spent years attending, and no one was talking about it. I realized, "Aha, this is my message. This is my purpose." So I wrote my first book, <em>Now, all these years later, I’m the only author in history—the only person—who has had works published by Hay House, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, Mindvalley, Nightingale-Conant, and the Chicken Soup for the Soul publisher. No one else in history has ever done that—I’m the only one.</p><p>As you mentioned, I’m known as the breakthrough coach—the person who helps people to make more in just 12 weeks than they did in the previous 12 months while actually winning their lives back. That’s really exciting. When you go to my website, you’ll see hundreds and hundreds of success stories and case studies. That’s how it really works.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Seven Figure Machine?</em> What was the purpose behind it?</strong></p><p>I didn’t have any resources, but I had resourcefulness. I realized I had this message that I had to bring to the world. It was my calling, but I didn’t know how the heck to do it. I had to spend what little money I had to learn how to make money online, put up a website, and eventually understand things like funnels and offers. I learned the hard way.</p><p>They’ll say, "Hey, look at my yacht. Look at my helicopter. Look at my jet. Aren’t I awesome?" And it’s like, yeah, you’re awesome, dude, but have you helped anyone else make money? Usually, the answer is, not so much.</p><p>And I will add to what you just said...A lot of times, those individuals' success comes from helping people—not in normal business. You learned through actual business, but now you also have case studies of helping people. That is critical when finding a mentor or someone to guide you.</strong></p><h3>Importance of Systems Over Personality</strong></h3><p>You can try to fake it, but it never works. So I realized I needed a system. I paid a lot of money for one but never got it. So I had to build it myself. I created the system that we now call the <em>Instead of vague advice like, "Get your name out there," or "Put out great content," I created an actionable checklist. My clients love that about me. They say, "Noah, you just give us exactly what to do." My pain is your gain—you’re welcome.</p><p>Let me ask you a question. I want to get into the strategy here in a second, but you said something I thought was really cool. A lot of people feel like, ‘I want to get to that seven-figure, eight-figure, nine-figure level, but I don’t have the personality of a CEO or high achiever.’ Now, as you progress and have more success, your confidence builds, but are you saying systems are as important—or more important—than personality?</strong></p><p id="">Yes. W. Edwards Deming, the famous management guru, said, "You put a good person in a bad system, and the system will win every time." The reverse is also true: If you put an average person in a great system, the system still wins.</p><p>Seven Figure Machine.</em> I created a system that anyone can use.</p><h3>Mindset and Speed in Business</strong></h3><p>So let me ask you this. And I’m imagining you’re obviously interweaving mindset into everything you’re doing because, as we know, that’s probably the most important thing out there. But is it really possible for somebody to do more in 12 weeks than they’ve done in the last 12 months, as you talk about in the book? Because I think some people probably feel skeptical, you know what I mean?</strong></p><p>That’s not how you build a house—certainly not a good one. What I’ve given you in the <em id="">Seven Figure Machine</em> is a blueprint. It’s a plan—a fill-in-the-blank system. I’m like the architect. But what I tell my clients is, "It’s your house. I’m not going to live in it. Build something that works for you, not just because someone else said you should."</p><p>Then I’ll ask, “What’s your offer? What’s your funnel?” And they’ll say, “I don’t have an offer yet or a funnel yet.” Isn’t that amazing? All they’re doing in that case is losing money. So my job is to back up and say, “Let’s start here, put everything in place step by step, and then you’ll have a house that’s actually livable.”</p><p>Yeah, and you’re right. We have to give people some grace here because no one teaches you this stuff, right? You don’t automatically know you need an offer first or a strategy or a message. And the challenge with most gurus is that they skip right to the chase, hooking you on some idea like, ‘Do my real estate thing,’ or whatever. But the other issue is that many people are promoting someone else’s offer, not their own. And that’s critical. You need to understand and build your own offer.</strong></p><h3>Lifestyle and Scaling</strong></h3><p>I know you’re great at this. So how do we create something that grows with better lifestyle integration, rather than sacrificing more time and energy?</strong></p><p id="">Oh, absolutely. That’s one of my big points. A lot of these so-called experts talk about hustle and grind. I call them the "hustle bros." They’re out there saying, “You’ve got to work 14, 16, 18 hours a day. And if you’re not working on Christmas Eve, you’re a loser.”</p><p>Here’s an example. One of my clients, Tamisa, is a business owner in Arizona. She joined my 12-week breakthrough program, where I help people make more in 12 weeks than they did in the last 12 months—while also winning their lives back. She was very skeptical, even calling herself a “seminar junkie.” She was already making six figures but kept hitting an income ceiling.</p><p><strong>It comes down to three words: money loves speed.</p><p>I encourage my clients to fail faster. I tell them, “90% of what I’ve done over the last 27 years has failed. But the 10% that worked made it all worthwhile.” I say that on purpose because I want people to realize that if I can do it, so can they.</p><p><strong><strong>Seven Figure Machine</em>. Could you share specific, tactical insights or steps people can start applying in their businesses right now?</strong></p><p>Seven Figure Machine</em> is structured around six essential steps that are critical to building a scalable business. Here’s the overview:</p><ol><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>These steps apply whether you’re just starting out, have been in business for a while, or are trying to break through to the next level.</p><p>That’s a really comprehensive roadmap. And I think what stands out is that these are foundational elements—things people might overlook in favor of trendy tactics. Could you give us an example of someone who’s applied these steps and seen success?</strong></p><p>I said, “Great. Why don’t you invest 10% of that million with me, and I’ll help you find the rest?” He agreed, and within just 10 months, we didn’t find him a million dollars—we found him 1.8 million. That’s an 18X return on his investment.</p><h3>Final Thoughts and Call to Action</strong></h3><p>I think what you’ve shared today is so valuable. For anyone listening, it’s clear that success isn’t about working harder—it’s about working smarter, with the right systems in place.
