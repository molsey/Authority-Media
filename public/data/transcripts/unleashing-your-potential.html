How are you?</p><p>I'm great, and I'm glad our schedules lined up because you have some really cool knowledge and it's a great story. I really feel like it'll be inspirational for people that are listening to the podcast.</strong></p><p>Before we get going, let me just give everybody a little bit of a taste. As you know, I don't do a lot of interviews on the podcast—it's just individuals that I really feel will bring a lot of value. I want them to know a little bit about you.</strong></p><p>So if this is your first time listening, by the way, make sure you hit that and subscribe. I want you to be with us every day. My goal is to help you to unleash your potential and create your best life.</strong></p><p>And Florian's here because—look—he's a high-performance coach specializing in AI entrepreneurs, investors, and family office generational wealth. His main focus is to help people gain clarity, focus, and strategic momentum.</strong></p><p>He's got a very deep background in business psychology and personal development. He's studied over 170 books, attended a ton of seminars, and really mastered the science of success. So we're gonna get into his story a bit and some of the things that he feels help his clients.</strong></p><p>Florian Roque's Background and Journey</h3><p>But Florian, maybe what you could do for us is, for those that don't know you, give us a little bit of your backdrop before we get into a whole bunch of the rest.</strong></p><p>Where did you come from? What was your journey? What sort of brought you into this realm of what you do today? Give us a little bit of your background and journey.</strong></p><p>I had the good fortune of starting personal development very early. I left school when I was 18, graduated with very good grades. So there was a promising future for me—at least from the academic path of how you think about life. When you finish school and get good grades, everything's open. But they don't necessarily teach you about real life skills and the skills of personal development and skill acquisition, do they?</p><p>Higher-volume sales. I realized that a lot of people who do well later in life in business tend to have a background in sales. It's either cold calling or door-to-door. So it was very beneficial. It teaches you a whole lot about yourself and about people. And yeah, strawberries are a great product to get your foot in the door.</p><p>Apart from doing well in school, I didn’t do well in life. Yes, I knew how to relate to people, but there were a lot of things I needed to clean up. And it was a wake-up moment when I came back at 20 years old, being in my old room, looking around, and realizing I hadn’t really progressed at all in those two years I was away.</p><p>It was so impressive to me that I listened to that audio probably 60 to 80 times in my car. I didn’t know there were other audio programs. That was the first thing I found. And the message of it—it sounds so simple—but the message was: if you want to change your life, you can. You can change your life by action.</p><h3>So I bought a pair of dumbbells and a crate of used books from Amazon because Jim Rohn said, “The book you don’t read won’t help.” You gotta read. That’s exactly how I got started. I read everything from the intersection between philosophy and psychology—all the old classics from psychotherapy and even psychoanalysis—Freud in the original.</p><p>So I started my own business instead. I served the industrial paint manufacturing industry in Germany because that was a business my father worked in. So I knew a little bit about it and thought, yeah, I’m so good at marketing, I’m going to apply that here. It did work, but I also realized it wasn’t quite my true passion.</p><p><strong>‍</p><h3><strong><strong>Yeah, a couple of reasons.</p><p>What do you want? And if they don’t know, then he goes, “What don’t you want? What do you want not anymore in your life?” And so that was it for me. I just knew that the way I was living—I did not want. I was looking down at myself: I was fairly skinny, not very strong, didn’t really like that I couldn’t relate to women, even though I wanted very much to.</p><p><strong>Thousands of hours of practice. That didn’t come naturally. I can send you some videos from five years ago—there was this very high-pitched voice, very forced, very pleasing. That’s all practice. That’s part of my message too: we gotta put in the hours and practice. Life changes through action—through behaviors.</p><p>And you uploaded this great video yesterday—we went through the last two of your 10... I forgot what you were calling it—but micro habits was one of them, neuroplasticity, and then the visualization and strategic micro habits that compound.</strong></p><p>But I also like what you said—and I want to make sure I really emphasize that for our listeners—you don't have to know what you want. But you do need to just start taking action, because along the way you're gonna create what you want.</strong></p><p>But it is interesting that you say—and I haven’t heard this a lot, so I like that you said it—if you don't know what you want, you can really identify what you don't want. Most people do know what they don't want. And that’s what you did. And as a result, you just started taking action to move away from that. Which is amazing.</strong></p><p>There are lots of psychological reasons why people can’t come up with what they want. That can be perfectionism, that can be not wanting to make a mistake, many different things. But if you ask them what they <em>So if I looked down at myself and said, “I'm skinny, I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't know what to do with my life,” then probably the inverse of that is: “I would love to have a loving relationship, be a little bit more physically capable, and have a direction in life.”</p><p>That is such a great point. You think about it—people do know what they don't want, and it usually is the inverse of that.</strong></p><p>Why do you think people don't recognize that? Is it that they are almost sometimes afraid of what they do know they want—but they don't think they can get it? Because you're right—it’s very intuitive. If you know what you don't want, you most likely know what you want.</strong></p><p>Why do you think that is? You've worked with a lot of individuals... maybe sometimes it just takes going that roundabout way. So let me ask you this:</strong></p><p>Identifying and Overcoming Patterns</h3><p>What took you from your passion of personal development and all the knowledge that you were doing into the actual field of working with people—coaching and consulting high-net-worth business owners and things like that? Was there a moment, a pivot moment? Or did you just evolve into that business?</strong></p><p>And his take on that was that he was distilling the best practices of past and present geniuses—Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, and even modern people we consider outstanding in their field. He was breaking that down into their habits, mindsets, and daily actions—and teaching that in a seminar.</p><p>So I went there. And the first time I set foot in that seminar—it sounds like I made up this story—but it was just like an inner knowing: “This is what I want to do in my life.”</p><p>So that was clear for me. But still, my life wasn’t quite working out the way I thought it should. And so this is where the journey of the actual work started—where I had to look at the topics within.</p><p>The Impact of Generational Trauma</h3><p>But they were also quite confused. From my mother’s side, all three children of my grandparents—my mother, her sister, and her brother—all ended up in tragedy. My mother and her sister committed suicide. My uncle worked himself into the ground. One day, he just passed out—and that was it. He just worked himself into the ground.</p><p>We have these invisible things that seem to be affecting us so much. And especially because I was running the same patterns. A lot of people here in the audience—and you probably as well—have realized from reading books on psychotherapy and psychology that oftentimes people do end up living out the same patterns as their parents, even though they don’t want to.</p><p>And a lot of people have that, right?</p><p>And I realized I was living out the same kind of depressed, manic-depression cycles, even though I tried so hard not to. That really led me to the work with psychedelics, with ayahuasca, with hypnotherapy—all kinds of tools in order to really pinpoint the psychological forces inside of us that make us live out these patterns.</p><p>should</em> be doing but can’t—I’ve gained the capacity to articulate that and help them with it.</p><p>So if you can’t even abstract from it, can’t explain it or give a name to it—you are identified with it. You’re in it. You’re living it out.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>see</em> their patterns. You have the awareness and identification, but then the ability to articulate that.</strong></p><p>And I’ve noticed—you really do emphasize, and you mentioned it a minute ago—habits and mannerisms. To be successful, you talk about how important that is.</strong></p><p>Could you give us some ideas of how people can start identifying their patterns and begin to shift them? Because that’s the hard part—changing. Do you have suggestions on ways people can start to shift their mannerisms and their habits?</strong></p><p>The Power of Friendships and Coaching</h3><p>That’s a two-sided answer. First of all: how do people identify that?</p><p>Another thing we can go into is the framework I help facilitate for people to do better in their life. One of those four factors is friends—including a spouse. Most people realize that having a supportive spouse is beneficial. But a lot of people do not see the value of friends—people you can talk to on a weekly basis, as a habit.</p><p>That’s how you get perception and awareness on your patterns.</p><p>You actually make a point—and I don’t mean to interrupt you—you make a great point. Most people just see friendship as “oh, that’s the fun stuff.” But what you're saying is, there’s a real tangible, specific result in your life—helping you to identify things—through friendships. That’s a great point.</strong></p><p>A lot of people I had to let go of in my life. But a few people—though not financially successful—had one area or strength that we could help each other with. We would have weekly accountability calls. We’d connect because I could point something out in him, and he had the maturity, the awareness, and the willingness to hear me—and vice versa.</p><p>If you don’t want to hire a coach, talk to friends—and be willing to be told the things you don’t want to see.</p><p>And now the second piece to your question—how do you actually shift?</p><p>For some people, it’s easier to do things together—with friends. That’s one way.</p><h3>Another way is to get really clear on your <em>Some people get motivated by realizing their past failure to act has brought them to their current, unwanted place. And by reemphasizing that pain—and visualizing it—that drives them forward.</p><p>And now we can go deeper into Tony Robbins’ psychology of human needs. I know you’ve talked about that on your channel. In the meta-programs, some people are <em>away from</em>.</p><p>For someone else, it’s like, “Let’s get clear on the future vision.” Once they put an image in front of them—a vision board—that’s what activates their momentum.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Yeah. For some people, it really is the circle of friends they surround themselves with.</p><p>Because the things you behold <em>Auditory, too. I’ve made myself my own affirmations and incantations—literally went through hundreds of sentences that were meaningful to me—and narrowed it down to 25–50 of the most impactful ones.</p><p>“All of the answers and resources are inside of me and within reach.”</p><p>Like, a tiny example—I was working with a client, and I noticed he had really good handwriting. He was trying to break out of his job. And I told him, “Do you realize that those handwritten posts on LinkedIn do <em>habit to freedom</em>.”</p><p>resource</em>.</p><p>It’s very interesting how that works—when you really <em>We could geek out on that all day, but this is...</p><p>And it is also interesting to me how sometimes the most successful people—because personal development isn’t just for people who aren't succeeding.</strong></p><p>Some of your clients—and some people I’ve worked with over the years—some of the most successful people struggle with self-doubt, with lack of clarity, with lack of focus.</strong></p><p>Which leads me to one of the questions I was going to ask you.</strong></p><p>Focus and Clarity in Business</h3><p>One of the core things I believe—and I think you've articulated this—that you do, and your purpose for helping individuals like AI SaaS founders, B2B AI owners, family office executives, and generational wealth families, is to create <em>clarity</em>.</strong></p><p>Could you speak to what you do and how you approach creating focus and clarity? What does that really mean in business?</strong></p><p>focus</em> on in your business?</p><p>can</em> do—but there are <em>right time</em>, aligned with your strategy. That’s where focus comes in.</p><p>In investing—families ask themselves: “AI is a great opportunity, blockchain, Web3... but we know commercial real estate. Should we go into those?”</p><p>existing</em> investment strategy, rather than pivoting into something entirely new?</p><p>collective thought energy</em>? What direction do we give our team? Because if we’re good leaders, the team will follow that direction.</p><p>really</em> important to them, and what their decision-making criteria are.</p><p>We’ll pick <em>that</em> right makes everything else easier.</p><p>“Why would you do that?”, “What’s the risk?”, “What’s the doubt?”, “Oh, it’s about this team member? Okay, but you’ve also committed to this, and you have <em>We walk through it.</p><p>intuitive art</em>, similar to how Tony Robbins has his “seven master steps of lasting change.” But what he does is still quite intuitive.</p><p>Because often, people think they <em>they</em> would truly decide—if no one else’s influence was present.</p><p>Inner Work and External Success</h3><p>Yeah. And life and business are so complicated.</strong></p><p>I was doing a podcast the other day—I’m a cohost on the Franklin Planner Podcast—and we were talking about digital overwhelm.</strong></p><p>It reminded me, as I was planning our discussion, about how you did a lot of deep work in Peru—and how it shaped your coaching style because of stillness. It’s the opposite of digital overwhelm, right?</strong></p><p>You had said that time in Peru really influenced your ability to get grounded. Can you speak to that? Because a lot of people have trouble blocking out the noise—which I think is critical to creating focus.</strong></p><p>When I speak to AI SaaS and app founders, they often struggle to <em>Just like it’s hard for some people to commit to one <em>one</em> business model.</p><p><li>What if it doesn’t work?</strong></li><li>What if I did <em>still</em> doesn’t work?</strong></li></ol><p>all the right things</em>, and it <em>That’s why it’s important to <em>We’ll say, “I don’t know if I can share this part of myself... What if people leave me? What if my spouse never talks to me again? What if my business partner quits and leaves me in debt?”</p><p>want</em> to confront that. We want to speak that through.</p><p>Healing the Inside to Fix the Outside</h3><p>inside</em> ourselves—things start to clean up on the <em>It’s like a mirror principle.</p><p>Some people chase things externally because they’re disordered inside. Like me, when I was younger—I chased different women out of a need for significance and validation.</p><p>If you don’t have a grounded sense of self, you’ll be drawn to every new opportunity. You won’t commit. You’ll switch paths constantly.</p><p>The benefit is that your <em>internal resonance</em> changes.</p><p>Very interesting.</strong></p><p>And yeah, I’ve worked with that a lot. Some listeners may not resonate with that, and sure—I might lose a bit of respect from a few people. But I don’t care. It’s part of my truth. It’s part of my brand.</strong></p><p>Correct. And that’s the thing. You can only speak your truth.</strong></p><p>And I think people are becoming more aware of this.</strong></p><p>Personal Development 1.0 is: “What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.” — Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich.</strong></p><p>Personal Development 2.0 is: Your <em>outer world</em>.</strong></p><p>And that outer world is <em>inner world</em> isn’t grounded, stable, and focused.</strong></p><p>Mindset as a Form of Action</h3><p>You said something recently that caught me off guard—but made a lot of sense.</strong></p><p>You said: “Mindset is a form of action.”</strong></p><p>Most people don’t think of mindset as action. Can you explain what you mean by that?</strong></p><p>You’re asking amazing questions. That’s why we vibe so well—because you really get the nuance behind this.</p><p>action-focused</em>. We all know—life changes through action.</p><p>affect</em> our ability to take action. If it were easy, everyone would do it.</p><p>But <em>Mindset is action because it's <em>When a sensation is evaluated, it becomes a <em>perception</em> forms how you act.</p><p>is</em> action. It changes how I respond.</p><p>filters</em>.</p><p>That’s what I mean by mindset as action. It’s a series of habitual, evaluative actions that define your life.</p><p>I love that. One of my early mentors, Robert Berg, who helped Tony Robbins and Deepak Chopra build their programs—he used to call it your ‘philosophy.’</strong></p><p>He said it’s not just beliefs—it’s your thought pattern. It’s a <em>for</em> you or <em><strong><strong><strong>do</em> decide your philosophy.</strong></p><p>Sure, you’ve been influenced by beliefs and people—but you can choose whether to accept those ideas or not. Wouldn’t you agree?</strong></p><h3><strong>LinkedIn, definitely.</p><p>For now—connect with me and shoot me a message on LinkedIn. Whether you're a family office CIO or just someone looking for guidance, I respond to people and give them what they need.</p><p><strong><strong><strong>What you behold is what you become.</p><p>Sometimes things get rusty—you’ve got to maintain your thoughts.</p><p>really</em> need all that stimulation and information?
