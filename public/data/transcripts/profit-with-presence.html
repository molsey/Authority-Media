<h2>Dr. Eric Holsapple on Leading with Presence</strong></h2><p><strong>I'm doing great, George. Thanks for having me on.</p><p>Oh, man, it's a pleasure. We have some very similar backgrounds. I'm super excited. So listen, guys, buckle up. I want to give you a quick little background.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Profit with Presence</em> and the founder of Living in the Gap. We're going to talk a little bit more about Living in the Gap, but his company focuses on teaching CEOs and professionals different ways to operate in mindfulness and still grow.</strong></p><p>So with that introduction, I would love it if you'd give us just a little bit of your background and this bridge that came from entrepreneurship or business into mindfulness. Give us a little bit of the backstory.</strong></p><p>I started in Denver and then moved to Los Angeles, traveling between Denver, Princeton, New Jersey, Western Canada, and reporting to the UK and Australia. I had all the outward signs of success. I had the six-figure salary, the Mercedes, the apartment. I had all those things. But I was not happy. I was overweight. I was single.</p><p id="">I remember my 30th birthday and a little bit after that, I got transferred to Boston to help with a company there. I couldn't button my top shirt button for my tie or my belt, and I wasn't giving in. I finally got an apartment there with a scale. I remember stepping on it and thinking, "God, you better make some changes, or you're not going to be around very long." I had one of those aha moments. So I made some changes. I left that job, lost a bunch of weight, started running again, and found yoga. That was my first entry into mindfulness.</p><p>So I tried meditation and had immediate results. I felt less stress, more focus, and improved relationships. My sports improved, and I was just happier. But for a lot of years, I didn’t come out as a meditator. I just did it on my own for 10 to 15 years. Gradually, as I got through my PhD program, back into developing with my own company, teaching on the side, and raising a family, people started noticing changes in me.</p><p id="">People started coming up to me saying, "What are you doing? I have this problem. What do you do? What do you know?" They noticed changes in me. I became someone easier to talk to than I had been historically because I run 150 miles an hour—I'm a hard-charging guy.</p><p>It made a huge difference—the same difference I noticed in my life, I saw others experience. Later, I launched Living in the Gap, a nonprofit where we train others to do that.</p><p>You have to. That’s...yeah, I totally agree with that. It’s funny—I feel like our stories are very similar. I’m learning more and more that when I interact with people, they have similar stories as well: chasing success, getting that success, realizing it’s not the end-all, be-all, and it’s not making them happy.</strong></p><p>I’ve got a question for you. It’s one that maybe you have an answer to, or maybe you have multiple answers to. You mentioned an aha moment. Do you think it was several years or a period of time? What do you think it was that caused this need or shift? Was it an aha moment? Or was it that you accomplished success but found it unfulfilling? What do you think it is? Because I had a similar type of experience.</strong></p><p>What I found for myself and many other successful people I’ve been friends with over the years is that we just keep moving the goalposts. We say, “Oh, it’s not this house, it’s that house. It’s the second car. Or I want to travel, so I’ll fly. I want to fly first class. No, I’d like to fly private. Now I want to take a trip to the moon.” We keep changing the goalposts.</p><p>We all know people who are monetarily successful but not happy. We also know people who have very little and are happy. But I think you can have it all. You can have those material things, but you have to realize that happiness doesn’t come from them. Happiness doesn’t come from just that pot of gold. You’ve got to have happiness to enjoy the pot of gold.</p><p>Yeah. I’m a big advocate of the fact that you can’t just achieve happiness; you’ve got to be happily achieving. And I think that’s exactly the shift to mindfulness, which is now taking the success you’ve had and bridging it into a mission, a purpose, a thing you’re doing with the book, your company, and Living in the Gap.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Efficiency and focus. First of all, on a personal level, it’s stress reduction. It makes you more grateful, makes you happier, and improves your relationships. But to make the business case for it, you have to show it improves business outcomes. In my case, it has.</p><p>When I’m focused, I can move the world in a few hours a day. If I’m distracted and divided, I can spend 12 hours a day and get very little done. There are so many options for our attention that we have to decide to reclaim it and focus on what we choose.</p><p>I totally agree. And I think entrepreneurs and CEOs often believe that the hustle is what has gotten them to where they are. When you shift to mindfulness, they worry it might feel like taking their foot off the gas. How do you explain to people that being mindful actually enhances focus, efficiency, and productivity, rather than taking their edge away?</strong></p><p>Kobe ended up scoring 60 points by passing more and focusing on opportunities, rather than forcing things. For real producers, it’s in their DNA—it’s not something they’ll stop doing.</p><p><strong>Exactly. Trust yourself. If I had to make the choice to produce a little less to be happier, more satisfied, and have better relationships, I’d choose that. But in my experience, you actually get more done in less time and make a bigger difference.</p><p><strong><strong>Profit with Presence,</em> and this idea of the 12 Pillars of Leadership. Do you want to take a minute and walk us through some of those?</strong></p><p>I’ve been able to bridge that gap and show that mindfulness is about focus and presence. We live in a capitalist society, and it’s absurd to think that making money makes you dirty. I buck that notion. We’re householders, not renunciants living on a hill in India. I run a business, I have a family, and I have responsibilities. It’s okay for me to make money. But what do I do with it?</p><p>Profit with Presence</em> is about doing both—making money and being mindful.</p><p><li>Be present and practice mindfulness.</strong> Everything of consequence—whether it’s athletics, music, or business—takes practice, and so does mindfulness. Develop practices that allow you to be more present in your life.</li><li>Identify your purpose in life.</strong> Purpose isn’t about profit. One inner purpose is to be awake and present. Life is a blessing, and recognizing that is a purpose in itself.</li><li>Create clarity, vision, intention, commitment, and habits.</strong> Clarity comes from mindfulness and purpose. Studies show that visioning can be as effective as taking action. Intentions are powerful. Commitment and habits must align—if your habits don’t support your commitments, it’s hard to live up to them.</li></ol><p>I love the foundational aspect because I think a lot of times people, especially as they get older or more established in their careers, feel like they’ve already set up foundational things. But as you said, sometimes their habits and commitments don’t line up. Until you consciously work through that process, you don’t see the disconnect.</strong></p><h3>Starting with Mindfulness</strong></h3><p>Let me ask you a question: for professionals—CEOs or business owners—who are limited on time, where do you recommend they start with mindfulness? Is it a practice, a course? Where should someone start to incorporate mindfulness into their daily life?</strong></p><p>The mind is so busy when we first start that jumping into 20 or 30 minutes can be counterproductive. What’s important is to do whatever keeps you consistent.</p><p>Another simple practice is a mindful walk. Take 10 minutes at lunch, leave your phone behind, and just walk. If you’re scrolling on your phone during the walk, it’s not mindful. We can unplug for 10 minutes and reconnect with nature or simply observe our surroundings.</p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Living in the Gap</strong></h3><p>One of my last questions is about your company, Living in the Gap. I don’t want to make assumptions, but I’m guessing it relates to bridging profit and presence. What does the name mean to you?</strong></p><p>Most of us have hobbies like painting, skiing, or fly fishing, where we create those gaps and are fully present. The goal is to bring that presence into other parts of life, like work.</p><p>I also think this is a big point: what’s your intention with the gaps? Most people’s intention is to fill them. If there’s a gap, they feel the need to fill it—scrolling through</strong></p><p>email, TV, Netflix, or whatever. But if your intention is to create more gaps, that’s where fulfillment and happiness come from. So, here’s a question for the audience: what’s your intention with the gaps? Is it to create more gaps or to fill them? I would argue that peace, fulfillment, and happiness come from creating more gaps.</strong></p><h3>Conclusion and Call to Action</strong></h3><p>I completely agree. This has been a fantastic conversation. I think we might want to dive deeper into this with our academy members. But at the end of the day, where’s the best place for people to connect with you, learn more about what you do, and get more information on mindfulness and leadership?</strong></p><p id="">Check out our website,<a href="https://livinginthegap.org">Profit with Presence,</em> also outlines a process for awakening and becoming more purposeful—not just at home but also at work. We spend more time at work than anywhere else, so it’s important to bring mindfulness there as well.</p><p>That’s fantastic. I’ll include the link to your site and the book in our show notes. To everyone listening, definitely grab a copy of the book. If you’re a high performer, CEO, business owner, or investor, find those opportunities to create more gaps. It’ll not only bring more fulfillment but also improve focus, clarity, and productivity.</strong></p><p>I believe it’s never too late to start practicing mindfulness, and it can go a long way for you. Dr. Eric, I really appreciate you being here.
