<h2>Master Sales Psychology with Simon Severino</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast. George Wright III here.&nbsp;We are joined today by an expert in Sales Strategies, Simon Severino. Welcome to the show, Simon.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Strategy Sprints,</em> which I love the word and the term in general, TEDx speaker, Forbes contributor, and triathlete.</strong></p><p>You're just an all-around very successful guy.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Yeah, it's funny because it was never a goal of mine. When I started working, I was a strategy advisor in a big firm.</p><p>So I was so passionate about doing that, that the next project came in, the next project came in, the next project came. When I went on my own and became an entrepreneur, I realized so many moving parts, but actually, it's marketing, sales, and operations.</p><p>It's really understanding the other side, asking really good questions, becoming a masterful listener and interviewer. And that's my passion. I love becoming better at buyer psychology and understanding why people buy what they buy, what's the best buying experience, and designing businesses accordingly, according to that buying experience.</p><p><strong><strong><strong>‍</p><h3>Effective Sales Strategies</strong></h3><p>But where does someone start to understand the psychology of the buyer? Where do you recommend people start to begin to understand what the mindset is of their ideal client?</strong></p><p>Now, what do you think makes the biggest difference in a high win rate in the 70% vs a very low win rate in the 10%? - it's the talking time. Talking time below 30% has a 70% win rate. So if you're talking 28% of the time, you are winning the deal 70% of the time.</p><p>So what are you doing when you're not talking? You're listening?</strong></p><p><strong id="">I love that because we always hear in sales, "Don't talk so much." And so many people with sales presentations are just trying to sell, close, and they don't stop to listen.</strong></p><p>But I never thought of tracking the metric of being aware of how much you are talking. So I like that a lot. But at what point, how do you become effective at asking the right questions? How do you become effective at really becoming strategic with your talk time?</strong></p><p>There are eight very specific stages for closing big deals. In each stage, they have three powerful questions that are relevant to their buyers and that they feel good asking because they show their expertise. So for example, if they say, "Yeah, but it's not the right time." Now you might have different ways of answering that, but if you ask the right question right now, they will see, "Oh my God, he's really intimately into my world."</p><p>And you don't have anything else. You don't have the product during the conversation. So you have only the conversation itself. So this is where you have to land value to move forward.</p><p>I actually really like how you put that—being strategic with your questions as well. You want to ask questions that are relevant to the buyer but also that showcase your expertise that allow you to lead the buyer.</strong></p><p>How do you shorten the path? Because I think a lot of people in sales try to think of how to shorten the path to get a deal. How do you shorten the path? What is the way to do that?</strong></p><p>And now we go into the sales conversation—the first 40 minutes. Because you only have that conversation; otherwise, they will not move forward. So you have to have a sample of that. And the best way to sample that is not through presentations; it's by asking the right questions. You will have some samples of your right questions.</p><p id="">For example, if your product is a CRM, you will ask how they follow up with leads right now. And then you'll ask, "What do you do if you forget to follow up?"</p><p id="">And they'll say, "Oh my God, how do you know that I frequently forget to follow up?"</p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Accelerating Business Growth</strong></h3><p>The whole idea behind your book—I wanted you to maybe take a minute and dig in a little bit to the “12 Ways to Accelerate Growth.” That’s what people want. They want to accelerate growth. And you have so many different things. I’m going to highly recommend that people listening to this check out the book because it’s packed with strategies and tactics. But what are some accelerated growth strategies that fit most businesses right now?</strong></p><p><li>Improve the win rate by 25%. You achieve this by creating the eight-step playbook and reducing your talk time to 28%. Then, you practice by recording, reviewing your tape, and improving like an athlete.</li><li>Reducing sales time is tricky. You can tackle it in two ways. First, you shorten the time from awareness to closing by using videos and voice messages in a high-frequency cadence during the first 12 days. We call it the "Relationship Building Sequence." By doing this, you create 12 times the value in the first seven days and shorten the sales cycle by at least 25%.</p><p>When you increase these three metrics by 25%, you effectively increase revenue by 99%.</p><p>Wow. I love the simplicity of that. There are so many levers in sales, but those three—pricing, win rate, and sales cycle time—are primary. Do you find that clients struggle the most with the first one, increasing their pricing?</strong></p><p>The second mistake is they over-explain. For example:</p><p id="">"Hey Simon, what’s the price of a sprint?"</p><p id="">"It's $27,000, but you also get XYZ..."</p><p>"Hey Simon, what’s the price of a sprint?"</p><p id="">"$27,000."</p><p><strong>It shows you own it. You believe in its worth and its impact. If you try to justify the price, you’re telling the prospect you don’t believe in it yourself.</p><p><strong><strong>We host a weekly "Sales Booster" group, where entrepreneurs bring their pipeline questions, and we review their sales process. The focus is always on one thing: customer intimacy.</p><p>Intimacy builds credibility. If a prospect feels, “This person understands my world,” you’ve gained credibility—and credibility is what gets you from a discovery call to a demo, and then to a closed deal.</p><p>I think you nailed it. Most people work too hard trying to build their credibility instead of immersing themselves in their prospect’s world. Credibility comes naturally when you truly understand your audience.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>It depends on their learning style.
