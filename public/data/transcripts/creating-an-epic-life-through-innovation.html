<h2>Creating an Epic Life Through Innovation with Terry Rich</strong></h2><p><strong><strong>Thank you very much. You're setting the bar pretty high here, George.</p><p>Oh no, I haven't even begun, man. Oh, okay. You gotta sit back for a minute, guys. Listen to me. I had a little short introduction for Terry, but I gotta read you some of this guy's background.</strong></p><p>It's definitely going to inspire you, but I love how you described Terry as creative, lucky, energetic, and fraud-busting. That is just like a taste of what we're talking about here. But at the end of the day, Terry is a keynote speaker and author. A panelist, been on the Tonight Show, giving away a billion dollars, cracked the largest US lottery fraud ever.</strong></p><p>This guy runs four completely separate businesses. He's a great speaker, great innovator. I love the idea of innovation, by the way. Terry, like there’s so much stuff to unpack in the limited time we have. I almost don't even know where to start.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Terry Rich's Background and Early Career</strong></h3><p>Sure. I fell into it. Hey, I grew up on a farm in Iowa, a little dinky town in Iowa, a town of 50. I went to school, going to be a math major or a physics professor, and some guy said, “Hey, you can go over here and make a talk and make a living.” I thought, “I'm in.” So I got into TV and radio and all my buddies went into broadcast television, and I was dumb enough to say I waited too long to send out a resume. So somebody called and said, “Hey, they need somebody to help with the cable television that's being built, brand new, just starting.”</p><p>And we built this cable system bigger and bigger. And in that, I learned a lot about innovation and entrepreneurship. 'Cause we couldn't touch anything that didn't seem to turn to gold. Everybody wanted cable television because it was the new up-and-coming thing with all these new networks.</p><h3>Entrepreneurial Ventures and Lessons Learned</strong></h3><p>So I had my own company doing those, and on the side, we started two or three other companies. Bought and sold a radio station. Started when we had the MPEG-1 transfer business and those sorts of things. But at age 50, you know what happened, George?</p><p>What's that?</strong></p><p><strong>And at that point, I said, “I want to get off the road. I wanna be with my family. I've made the money,” and I got a call. Someone said, “Hey, they're about ready to close the zoo. Would you be interested in running the zoo?” I told you I was on the farm. I thought, “If I could be a farmer, I sure as heck could take care of giraffes too.” So we turned a zoo that was losing $600,000 a year, turned it around. Got a lot of people in marketing, promotion, doing basic business blocking and tackling. And ultimately, I got a $15 million endowment. So it's gonna be around forever. Built it to the second-largest cultural attraction in the state.</p><h3>Lottery Career and Major Fraud Case</strong></h3><p>So today I travel the world telling people the story—how it happened and why—and how you want to protect yourself internally so you don't have internal fraud. Don't go through what I went through. So that's my history. That's my deal.</p><p>Wow. You bridged over a lot of really cool stuff, which we are gonna try to unpack for a sec.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Insights on Failure and Success</strong></h3><p>It seems to me that you've done some pretty random stuff, but you've really done things that when you talk about 'em, they sound like things you love and enjoy. Do you think a secret or a key to your success is that you were doing things you love, or were you just following the paths that weren't necessarily things you were passionate about, but you turned them into that? Because going from business to fraud to cable to all those different things, it seems like it was almost kind of happenstance to a degree. Or was it that you were following paths that you were good at? Help me understand a little bit.</strong></p><p>The second is failure is the first step to success. I failed many times. In fact, the first time I failed, I got into the cable business. I was on camera, I was doing a TV show, and I looked out, and I didn't have any of the five o'clock shadow—and this five o'clock. So I wrote to Gillette and said, “Hey, I love your razor, and if you'd like me to come out and be on TV, I'd love to do that.” So I wrote 'em a letter, sent it to New York, thinking in two weeks they'd call me and I'd be on national television. And during those two weeks, probably like you feel when you play Powerball or Mega Millions, I thought, “What if it happened?” Yeah. It's better to have tried and failed than to succeed at doing nothing. That was my old college professor: “Try something new.”</p><p>I wrote 44 letters. Only one person responded. When we wrote 44 letters or press releases, yeah, only one press person called. I failed 43 times. But that one person was from United Press International. They threw it on the national scope, and with all the publicity we got, we had ABC, NBC, CBS, Today Show, Good Morning America—all in this little town of 50 people. And 12,500 people showed up.</p><p>All because I failed 43 of the 44 times.</p><p>Yeah. So I love your perspective and your message on failure because I think a lot of people, as entrepreneurs, they hear, “You’ve gotta fail. It’s the gateway to success, it’s the price you pay for success.” But it seems to me—and I’ve heard this from a few real high-end CEOs—that it’s also your perspective on failure. People that don’t view failure as a bad thing that you gotta go through to be successful. You seem to have this perspective that failure is really an opportunity for success. It’s just the way you phrase it. To me, it makes me feel like your perspective on failure is not the struggle you gotta go through, but literally the opportunities you go through to get to success. Would you say that’s a good description?</strong></p><p>We failed over 90% of the time when we sent three men to the moon. When they said, “10, 9, 8, 7…” they didn’t say, “Okay, we’ll talk to you in two weeks. It’s all planned out.” They said, “Oh my God, it’s going the wrong way. We gotta course correct.” Over 90% of the time. And how many times have you tried that one idea you think’s a million-dollar idea, and some little thing didn’t go quite right, so you quit? You can’t. That failure is the first step to success.</p><p>Yeah. It was. You find ways to make it work.</strong></p><p><strong>And you gotta accept change. Most people say, “Hey, it’s been working. Why do we need to change?” Think about taxi drivers who thought there would never be anything called Uber in the day. You gotta realize that things change, and you’ve gotta be part of that change.</p><p>That’s what boils down to the book that I wrote called <em>When you come back, though, you let the lawyers and the accountants and everybody in a meeting. And again, when you create a new idea, you want as diverse a look as possible. If everybody looks like you or me now, we aren’t gonna get the best idea, 'cause we’re in a global society now, a very diverse society.</p><p>Yeah.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m not very creative.</p><p>No, but you know what? I just love the way you put things, and it’s both from a frame of reference of experience but also opportunity and openness. Because you have so many things going on. But being open, being willing to fail, knowing that you’ve gotta do things that are new.</strong></p><p>So let me ask you this, because I wanna dig for a second into this lottery concept—this whole idea.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>The $80 Billion Gamble,</em> right? <em>Sure. I took the lottery job. You come in, you get all excited. “Hey, let’s paint the wall green, let’s put animals on the lottery,” all these different things that are going on. And all of a sudden, one day, I get a call. They say, “Hey, something’s scurry here.” I was actually on a cruise ship. I’m on vacation. They said, “Someone just called in. We had a lottery ticket worth $16.5 million. It was a multi-state game—we had about 18 states. It’s kinda like a mini Powerball so that we could have bigger jackpots.” And they said, “Hey, we had a winner on this jackpot, and no one showed up.”</p><p>But we got a call from a lawyer in Canada who said, “I have the ticket, and here are the serial numbers.” And no one else could tell you the serial numbers, 'cause only the person with the ticket had it.</p><p>Ding, ding. She said she sent it up to our security and our public relations folks, and they started asking questions. And they said, “What were you wearing?” Obviously, when you buy a lottery ticket, you’re on camera in a C-store.</p><h3>Cracking the Lottery Fraud Case</strong></h3><p>The client? We couldn’t figure out how that person would know anybody or why he—why that person just wouldn’t come in. And we ultimately released the video of the guy buying the ticket, and someone said, “Wait a minute, that is Eddie Tipton.”</p><p><strong>And we couldn’t figure out how he was associated with the guy in Texas, but we connected the two because they were on—here’s one lesson—if you’re gonna do something illegal, don’t use social media. One was the CEO of the other’s IT company in Texas. And so we connected them and ultimately busted him. And he received up to 25 years in prison.</p><p>And… The Associated Press picked up that quote and put it on the national wires. And a guy in Texas said, “Wait a minute. I think that’s a guy who was investigated for money laundering.” So they said, “Check his brother too.” And all of a sudden, we busted five jackpots across the United States.</p><p>So long story short, we busted it. I learned some simple lessons in life. If you want to know if somebody can steal within your—get a good employee.</p><p><strong>If usually—point number one, according to the Certified Fraud Examiners—is you want more money. You, George, you and I want to always make more money.</p><p>The second is opportunity. Think about a church where the church secretary, Aunt Wilma, takes in the money and also writes the checks and also writes the purchase orders. You’re probably ripe for fraud. That's an opportunity.</p><p>Put those all three together. You’re ripe for fraud. So that’s kind of the story I tell when I go out on the road.</p><p>I love though that you learn lessons from all these things, whether it’s just something that happens or not. And I think that integrity and ethics and things like that are a big thing in business right now because so many people don’t know what to believe. They don’t know what to see there. But there are some simple principles like you just mentioned. So I really like that. I think that’s a really good thing.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Sure. What are some things you can speak to there, big or small? The big companies often do this—research and development, they call it. But in a smaller company, I suggest that whenever you make money—you can’t really do this coming outta college. You don’t wanna bet the whole farm and then lose it all on your first idea. So when you start making money, I tell people, “Go to work for someone and then start a company at night and weekends until you get the cash flow going to start it.”</p><p>So take a piece of that money and put it to the side. I think that’s probably the big one. The other is creating new ideas. We came up with an idea in the lottery. Because it’s a state organization, we all think government employees don’t want to change anything, right? So first thing I go in, “Let’s do this, let’s do that,” and everybody’s going, “Oh my God, that’s too much. We can’t do it.”</p><p><strong>And I said, “No, I’m just trying to give you an idea.” I didn’t realize that when you’re the king—if you’re the king and you say, “Oh, poop,” everybody heads for the bathroom because employees wanna please the boss, right? So we came up with an idea called COT—C.O.T.—and the idea is so they understand when I really want something done. When you do an email or I’m talking to you face-to-face, if I say “Action required,” which I do maybe one to two percent, that means, yeah, it’s job-changing. You better do it, or you could get fired.</p><p>The rules are, if I say “Consider or throw away” in an email, you can hit delete. You don’t even have to read it. I just wanted to get the idea off my chest. And I don’t want you to write back, “Oh, great idea, boss.” No. I just want to give you the idea.</p><p>Now she or he can send that idea, put C.O.T., and know that it went out and got a chance to give it. And it creates a whole different innovative environment to try to get all these ideas together. And then again, put ‘em to the side until you have the group to say, “Now, let’s act. What’s our priorities? What sounds like something we should do?”</p><p>I think it gives permission, like you said, because what I love about that, ‘cause I’ve had a lot of experience with that over the years, is that if you’re a boss or you’re running a business or you’re a CEO, C-level executive, and you have an idea that you wanna bounce off your team, a lot of times they’re gonna take that idea like it’s worth a million bucks. And they’re gonna go down the road, and they’re gonna spend all this time. And you’re like, “Man, I didn’t know you were gonna do that.” And all they’re trying to do is impress you. But that idea of C.O.T. is that I wanna give you permission to take an idea and actually be critical about it. And if it works, go with it. And if it doesn’t, throw it away. Giving that permission upfront—I love that because it also saves time, but it allows people to be innovative. It allows people to say, “Ooh, okay, let’s go with this.” So that’s actually a great concept. I love that.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Entrepreneurs are often bad CEOs when it’s all said and done because we’re here, we love ideas, we love to send them out, we love to get ‘em going, but you really need to make sure you surround yourself with a good accountant, a good lawyer, a good salesperson—people who are experts in their own field.</p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Winning Strategies for the Lottery</strong></h3><p>I’ve got a random question for you though. You’ve talked about all this lottery stuff. You ran the lottery, you built a lot—you basically caused massive success, identified things. How do you win the lottery? Is that a thing? Is that a question I could ask you? Is it completely random chance that people are spending all this money or—come on, like you gotta give me an answer to that question.</strong></p><p>You can’t do that if you’re playing poker on the internet to Belize or to Malta or some other place. So yeah, it is an amazing and, I think, a very fair and honest game. People like to gamble. Now, if you wanna win, here’s the secret. The worst payout is the lotto games. They’re usually about 50% of the money going back to the players, but they’re used to build big aspirational prizes. So if you like to win the big prize—if you like to get into raffles and that sort of thing—play Powerball. Play Mega Millions. Play a lotto game.</p><p>If you have $50, divide it by 10. Whatever your dollar bill is, divide it by 10 and buy 10 tickets of that denomination. The same roll and the same deal—10 tickets in a row. You’ll probably get one or two winners. Now, you probably won’t win more than what you put in, but you can say you won.</p><p>You can feel like a winner.</strong></p><p><strong>That’s right.</p><p><strong><strong>The easiest way is terryspeaks.com. That’s my website, terryspeaks.com. If somebody has an event and has an event planner—if somebody’s looking for the books—you can do that. If nothing else, get a good laugh and do that. I’ve got a TV show that right now is also on Very Local, which is the Hearst streaming service, called Soccer Slam. Twenty years ago, we did a show. They did a documentary on it where we took soccer and thought everybody was bored with it, so we made it full-contact, indoor soccer. We had people fighting, we had—we threw in an extra ball here and there, and then we hired professional fighters.</p><p>Oh wow.</strong></p><p><strong>So how about the million-dollar idea though? Can we do that, George, before we go?</p><p>Yeah, that was my very last question. You—we talked before about you had a new million-dollar idea. So guys, you heard it here first—unless I edit this out later because you can’t hear it, because I’m gonna take it for myself. Go ahead. Let’s hear this new idea you have.</strong></p><p><strong>Here's the million-dollar idea. So we had Mega Millions, we added Powerball. So we crossed, sold those two together in all the states, and they said, what are some good things? Let's come up with ideas. Remember how we're brainstorming? What's the idea for doing Mega Millions, Mega Millions promoting it?</p><p>Then I got somebody who said, "You're gonna have problems 'cause you gotta get through the atmosphere. It breaks up if you use a laser or a spotlight." So my answer today is I need someone who knows Elon Musk. 'Cause we could put the laser or the spotlight on the satellite. Then we could get that focused signal up to the moon. We could own the moon as a billboard.</p><p>You got it. Something big.</p><p>Wow, Terry, there's no question. You think big. There's no question. You don't think small. So I love it, man. Talk about innovation—the moon for a billboard. That's a great idea. Hey, count me in on that one. Let's come up with some ideas and work on that baby together, okay? I love it.</strong></p><p>Hey, listen guys, thank you for joining us today.
