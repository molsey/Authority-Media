<h2>Sean Stockell: Authority via Streaming Media</strong></h2><p>‍</strong></p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast, George Wright III here.</strong></p><p>Today, I’m excited to dive into a topic we haven’t explored before: connected TV and streaming. As many of you know, I’ve been a strong advocate for building authority and visibility, and today’s guest is an incredible example of just that.</strong></p><p>Your Home Digital</em>, the founder and executive producer of <em>Your Home, One Source</em>. Partnered with Cathy Ireland Worldwide, Sean leads digital media and marketing strategies for numerous top-tier brands and influencers. Just this year alone, Sean’s platforms have achieved over 6.3 million new mobile viewers and amassed 53 million total views.</p><p><strong>I grew up in the Midwest, in St. Louis County, Missouri. I got my start in the savings and loan industry after working with my father at his real estate company while attending community college. I first earned my real estate license, followed by my broker’s license, before transitioning to the savings and loan sector.</p><p><strong>Great question! Change is inevitable in every industry. The rise of the internet in the late ’90s, and by the year 2000, made it clear that no matter your field, being active online was essential to stay relevant.</p><p>For instance, at the last bank I worked at, I built their lending division and developed their website. By the time we sold the bank seven years later, 80% of our mortgage business came through the website I helped create. That was a turning point for me—I realized the potential and excitement of working in digital.</p><p>Did you have any tech experience before diving into digital media? Or did you learn as you went?</strong></p><p>I thought it was a fantastic idea, so we spent 1994 and 1995 working on it as a side hustle. We called it <em>This experience taught me the basics of tech development, and while it wasn’t directly connected to what I do today, it laid the foundation for understanding digital tools.</p><p><strong><strong>It wasn’t an easy journey. Around 2008, the housing crisis hit, and the industry was in turmoil. Thankfully, I had already started building the foundation for <em>At the same time, I was still working full-time at a community bank, building their residential lending division. This dual approach—working full-time while developing my platform in the evenings—was similar to what I had done with <em>What really made a difference, though, was surrounding myself with people smarter than me. I put together an outstanding board of advisors, including our chairman, David McCain, who was previously the Chief Legal Officer at Lennar Corporation, the largest publicly traded homebuilder at the time. Building the right leadership team was crucial to our success.</p><p>What strategy did you use to attract such a strong leadership team? Many people have innovative ideas but struggle to bring in the right people.</strong></p><p>These presentations were highly illustrated with great graphics, which became a hallmark of <em>The presentations were kept short—about 10 slides—because you don’t want to overwhelm people. Then, I set up in-person meetings, often over lunch, to explain my concepts. Within 30 minutes to an hour, I could share my vision and invite people to join me.</p><p><strong>Your Home, One Source</em>?</strong></p><p>By January 1, 2016, we officially launched <em>Your Home, One Source</em>. Over the years, we gradually expanded our leadership team, bringing in experts from various industries. For example, one of our early advisors was a former general manager of Home Shopping Network.</p><p>We aimed to centralize all these resources, creating an Amazon or Walmart-style platform for the home industry. Over the first five years, we partnered with over 40 brands, including Home Advisor, Lowe’s, Home Depot, and BobVila.com.</p><p>Education isn’t always the obvious path for a business. What made you choose it?</strong></p><p>First, the housing crisis taught me that a lack of education can lead to poor decisions. If more people had been properly informed, perhaps the financial collapse wouldn’t have been as devastating.</p><p>In the first five years, we built a massive platform with 900 pages of content, nearly 400 articles, and tools like checklists and calculators. We even had 22,000 outbound links to resources like Realtor.com, FEMA, and the National Association of Realtors.</p><p><strong><strong>Your Home, One Source</em> lead to the creation of <em>The transition to streaming started early on. In 2016, during our first year in business, I purchased the domain <em>We produced over 200 videos for brands like Anderson Windows and focused on visually engaging, story-driven content. This set the stage for more video production, including commercials for home industry brands.</p><p>After a year of research and planning, we launched <em>For those unfamiliar, <em>Our platform stands out because of its focus on short-run programming. While platforms like Netflix and Disney+ focus on movies, we deliver shorter content—ranging from 3-minute videos to 60-minute shows, with an average length of 17-20 minutes.</p><p><strong><strong>Streaming will continue to evolve. While cord-cutting has been a major trend, people will still pay for subscriptions alongside free options. It’s similar to how newspapers and print media adapted to the internet—they didn’t disappear but found a new equilibrium.</p><p><strong>First and foremost, control and own your content. Don’t enter into licensing agreements that transfer control to another party. These arrangements often promise monetization but don’t always deliver, and you may struggle to regain control of your content later.</p><p>Many larger networks impose rigid requirements, such as specific time formats or strict production standards. We encourage creators to prioritize authentic storytelling, which resonates more with audiences on mobile platforms.</p><p><strong><strong>Your Home TV</em>. Can you elaborate?</strong></p><p>That’s why we designed <em>By partnering with us, creators can focus on what they do best—producing content—while we handle the technology and distribution. It’s a turnkey solution that lowers costs and accelerates time to market.</p><p><strong><strong>Trust is everything. People do business with brands they trust and return to those that provide exceptional service. That’s why we’ve always emphasized education and transparency.</p><p>When you’re seen as a trusted advisor, your audience stays loyal, which in turn attracts new partners and opportunities.</p><p>What’s next for <em>We’re focused on expanding our reach and refining our content strategy. Short-run programming remains our core, as it aligns with modern viewing habits. Whether it’s a 3-minute segment or a 20-minute episode, the goal is to deliver value quickly and efficiently.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>What parting advice would you give to someone completely new to streaming?</strong></p><p>Remember, control your content, choose flexible partners, and focus on mobile-friendly formats. Streaming offers incredible opportunities, but success comes from authenticity and consistency.</p><p>Your Home TV</em>, simply type “Your Home TV” into your browser.
