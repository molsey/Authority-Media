<h2>Tom Hazzard: Build Influence with Podcasting</strong></h2><p><strong>I’m George Wright III, here. I’m especially excited today to introduce a new partner of the Evolution Group and <em><strong><strong><strong>The Daily Mastermind</em> has partnered with him.</strong></p><p>In addition to being an inventor and entrepreneur, Tom is also a podcaster. He co-hosts multiple shows and starts a new podcast every year, putting himself in the shoes of his clients. His work has been featured in <em><strong><strong>The Daily Mastermind</em>. How are you doing, Tom?</strong></p><p>The Daily Mastermind</em>.</p><p>I’m thrilled to have you here. Many of our listeners might not know this, but we’ve been working together on some in-depth strategies recently. With so much focus on authority marketing, I’ve found that podcasting consistently rises to the top as one of the most effective tools available. Before we dig into specific strategies, could you share a bit about your journey and what led you to podcasting?</strong></p><p><strong>That’s a great question, and one I don’t get asked often! My educational background might surprise you—I actually studied art. I went to the Rhode Island School of Design, where I focused on industrial design. By nature, I’m a designer, inventor, and creative thinker.</p><p>However, by 2014, the industry had shifted. Offshore manufacturing, among other changes, pushed us to explore new ways to raise awareness for our design brand. That’s when Tracy—an avid podcast listener—suggested starting a podcast.</p><p><strong>Our first show, which focused on the niche topic of 3D printing, became an immediate success. Within a short time, <em>What set us apart was our willingness to innovate. Instead of following the standard advice, we tested unique strategies to maximize podcasting’s value. The results surprised even us. Other business professionals began noticing our success and asked if we could help them replicate it. At first, we hadn’t considered turning podcasting into a business, but the demand was undeniable.</p><p>It’s incredible that you transitioned your podcasting success into a business. What do you think contributed to that success right off the bat?</strong></p><p>Every podcaster at the time was simply putting out audio shows. Back then, few were doing video because it was a lot more work. Most serious podcasters had websites with “show notes,” but those notes were usually just short summaries of the podcast.</p><p>Inc. Magazine</em>. She knew the power of blogging and suggested creating full-fledged blog posts for each episode. We also discovered that Google ranks blog content created from human speech very highly—higher than content that looks like it’s traditionally written.</p><p><strong>It was incredibly effective. When we launched our 3D printing podcast, our website came out of Google’s “penalty box” in just over two months. Usually, it takes a new site four months or more to build trust with Google.</p><h3>SEO and the Longevity of Blog Content</strong></h3><p>That’s incredible! So it wasn’t just about the podcast or the blog—it was about strategically using both to increase visibility. Can you expand on why the blog posts were so valuable?</strong></p><p>Podcast directories like Apple Podcasts and Spotify only search titles and descriptions, not the full content of your episodes. On the other hand, Google indexes everything in a blog post, making it searchable for any topic discussed in the episode.</p><p>That’s huge. So Google essentially unlocks the potential of your content, allowing you to reach a much larger audience. But what about the long-term value of blogs?</strong></p><p>One time, I received an angry phone call from a CEO we mentioned in a podcast. He found out about it through a Google alert—just 11 hours after we published the blog post for that episode. That blog post started ranking on high-value keywords within a day and continues to rank years later.</p><p>That’s remarkable. So the blog posts not only increase visibility but also build equity in your website over time. And you mentioned earlier that Google ranks speech-based blogs higher than traditional written content. How does that work?</strong></p><p>However, there’s more to it than just slapping a transcript on a page. The content needs to be formatted properly and optimized for SEO. When done right, these blogs can rank for dozens of keyword phrases, driving organic traffic to your site consistently.</p><p><strong><strong>Sure. Multicasting is about taking a single piece of content and distributing it in multiple formats across various platforms. For example, one podcast episode can generate:</p><ul>A video for YouTube and your website</li><li>A long-form blog post for your website</li><li>Additional micro-content like quotes or audiograms</li></ul><p><strong>It’s extremely effective, especially for businesses. While podcasts and videos are great for connecting with your audience, the blog content provides the highest return on investment over time.</p><h3>Building Authority and Maximizing Influence</strong></h3><p>Let’s talk about authority for a moment. One of the reasons I often recommend podcasting is its ability to establish credibility and trust in a space. How have you seen podcasting help people build authority?</strong></p><p>Look at news programs or talk shows. They used to feature authors with new books, but now they often invite podcast hosts. Having a podcast puts you on the map as an authority in your niche.</p><p><strong>Maximizing influence comes down to being intentional about how you use your content. For instance, multicasting your podcast ensures it reaches as many people as possible. But it’s not just about distribution; it’s about making your content easy to consume and share.</p><p>Another strategy is to focus on the longevity of your content. Podcasts combined with SEO-optimized blogs give you a dual benefit: short-term engagement with listeners and long-term visibility through search engines.</p><p>That’s an excellent point. Now, a common question I hear from people is, “Is it too late to start a podcast?” With so many podcasts out there, what’s your take on this?</strong></p><p>What’s important to remember is that podcasting is a long-term investment. It takes time to build an audience and see results, but the sooner you start, the sooner you’ll benefit.</p><p>That’s reassuring to hear. I love how you frame it as a long-term investment. It’s about consistency and strategy.</strong></p><h3>The Power of Promotion and Syndication</strong></h3><p>You’ve also mentioned promotion as a critical part of podcasting. What are some innovative ways podcasters can promote their shows?</strong></p><p id="">One of the most effective strategies is what we call "Promo Cast." It’s a unique way to get your podcast in front of new audiences through targeted advertising.</p><p>The beauty of this approach is its scalability. You can start small—spending just a couple hundred dollars a month—and still reach hundreds of thousands of potential listeners. Over time, this creates measurable growth in your audience.</p><p>That’s a game-changer. So you’re essentially creating a marketing funnel for your podcast that’s affordable and effective.</strong></p><h3>Conclusion and Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>I love how you’ve broken this down. Podcasting isn’t just about recording episodes—it’s about creating an entire ecosystem of content that builds authority, drives visibility, and fosters meaningful connections. As we wrap up, what advice would you give to someone who’s thinking about starting a podcast but hasn’t taken the leap yet?</strong></p><p>Also, don’t let perfectionism stop you. Your first episodes won’t be perfect, and that’s okay. What matters is getting your message out there and improving as you go.</p><p>That’s such valuable advice. And it’s a great reminder that podcasting is a journey. As long as you start, you’re already ahead of the game.
