<h2>Rob Kessler’s Million Dollar Collar Story</strong></h2><p><strong>Rob's an inventor, a businessman with 20 years in sales across multiple industries. He's the inventor of the Million Dollar Collar and now another shirt line, Go Tieless. He's got all kinds of history, which we're going to get into, and I'm really excited to have you here, Rob.</p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Early Entrepreneurial Journey</strong></h3><p>So let’s go back a little bit here. Can you give us a little bit of an entry into the entrepreneurial world? Were you like six years old doing lemonade stands, or did you make a transition into entrepreneurship? Tell us a little bit of the backdrop. Let’s take a few minutes on that.</strong></p><p>He would do it for me, my brother, and my sister and be like, “Okay, if you want to be an idiot and spend all your money on Monday and Tuesday, you’re gonna starve on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.” So oddly, at 10 or 11 years old, I was getting financial schooling and trying to be responsible with money pretty early.</p><p>He made me feel, at 17 years old, like I had some ownership in the business. It was cool because I started doing inventory, ordering, a little bit of accounting, and sales. I would go up at night, tear the whole store apart, and remodel and relay everything out. He was like, “Whatever you want to do, man.”</p><p>Wow. So you had an owner mentality. Was it because he started that, or did you develop that? There’s not a lot of people out there right now with an owner mentality. Obviously, most of our listeners have that mentality because that’s what they want to pursue. Did you have a job and an owner mentality, or did that situation set you up for it?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah. At 12 or 13 years old, I was walking with the lawnmower, and I thought, “Somebody’s gonna drive by and see me cutting this grass so well that they’re going to hire me to do their grass.” That’s literally what I thought while pushing the lawnmower at 13 years old.</p><p>I’m gonna put a pin in that for a second because I talk all the time about how it doesn’t matter whether you have a job, a business, or if you’re doing something you don’t believe is your end game—how you do anything is how you do everything. Whether you’re mowing a lawn at 17 or stuck in a job at 40, how you approach anything determines your trajectory. Would you agree that having that owner mentality is what put you on this path?</strong></p><h3>The Birth of Million Dollar Collar</strong></h3><p>Let’s transition into something because you made a comment, and I actually brought it up earlier. This is a comment, guys, just in full disclosure, that I brought up myself. I always—when I’m not in a t-shirt and hat like today—I’m usually in dress shirts. Lately, I’ve been wearing them untucked, but this idea of the collar has always driven me crazy. I like collar stays, but the lapel on the shirt always wrinkles up. I can starch it all I want, and it still doesn’t look good.</strong></p><p>So I ran across Rob, and he created this company, Million Dollar Collar. I want you to talk to us about how that happened. It’s such a cool story. Sometimes the most amazing and obvious ideas are the ones you look at and think, ‘Why didn’t I think of that?’ Tell us about Million Dollar Collar. How did it come about?</strong></p><p>I’d unbutton a couple of buttons, but the shirt was always sagging and drooping, especially if I wore a jacket. Fast forward to our wedding—I got married on the beach in Jamaica, totally casual, feet in the sand. My brand-new, freshly pressed shirt was a crumbled mess within 30 minutes. It was starched, ironed, and perfect, but the humid Jamaican air ruined it. All day long, I was yanking at my collar, trying to get the front to sit up. You could see my tank top underneath—it just looked terrible.</p><p>Dress shirts were designed to be buttoned all the way up and worn with a tie, so they didn’t need structure in the placket. I took the idea of a collar stay, made it nine inches long, and put it down the front of the shirt. That’s Million Dollar Collar. We call it a placket stay—it’s exactly like a collar stay but for the placket. It’s sewn into your shirts.</p><p><strong><strong>From the inception, it was a grind. After our wedding, I started with a piece of cardboard—just to see if a little structure made a difference. I showed it to my wife, and she said, “Oh my God, I finally get what you’ve been complaining about!” But obviously, cardboard wasn’t going to work.</p><p>I worked with a plastics company and developed this proprietary material. It’s super lightweight and flexible but rigid enough to hold up the collar. It’s soft enough to be sewn through, which is key because it’s secured with stitches where the collar band meets the placket. Once it’s in, it lasts the life of the shirt.</p><p>Guys, hear that? He didn’t dabble—he went deep. He learned about temperatures, materials, and manufacturing processes. If you’re going to solve a problem, you’ve got to be persistent and committed. Dabbling doesn’t create success. You need to go deep, learn the nuances, and solve the problem fully. That’s inspiring, Rob.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>It was far from smooth sailing. After developing the material and finalizing the design, I still had to figure out how to make it scalable. I had to think about the costs, the manufacturing process, and whether this would be viable for mass production.</p><p><strong>Exactly. Once we had the design, we started pitching it to other brands. We wanted to license the technology to get it into as many shirts as possible. But the response we got from the big brands was always the same: “Sounds interesting, but we don’t know if our customers care about this enough to justify adding it.” So, we decided to sell directly to consumers.</p><p><strong><strong>It was both. When we started selling Million Dollar Collar directly to consumers, we got a lot of feedback. The biggest challenge was the installation process. People loved the idea but didn’t want to take the extra step of finding a tailor to sew it into their shirts. So, we started offering pre-installed options. I bought wholesale dress shirts—brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger—and installed the stays myself. Then we sold them as finished products.</p><p><strong>Million Dollar Collar is still the core of our business. It’s what got us here, and it’s what will keep driving us forward. But Go Tieless is our way of showing other brands what’s possible. It’s a proof of concept. If we can build a successful brand around this technology, it opens the door for licensing deals with other companies.</p><p><strong><strong>It’s definitely a juggling act. But I’ve always been someone who thrives on progress. Even when things get tough, I just focus on the next step. It’s about setting small, achievable goals and building on them. That’s what keeps me going. And I’ve got an amazing support system—my wife has been my rock through this entire journey. She’s always believed in me, even on the days when I doubted myself.</p><p><strong><strong>The biggest lesson is to trust your gut but also do your homework. A lot of the money I lost was from trusting people who didn’t deliver on their promises. I hired PR firms, marketing experts, and consultants who said they could take my business to the next level, but they didn’t understand my product or my vision. Now, I’m much more careful about who I work with. I make sure they align with my goals and actually understand what I’m trying to achieve.</p><p>That’s such an important point. A lot of entrepreneurs fall into the trap of thinking they need outside experts to succeed, but no one knows your business better than you. Any other advice for entrepreneurs who are just starting out?</strong></p><p>But most importantly, make sure you’re passionate about what you’re doing. If you’re just in it for the money, you’ll give up when things get tough. Passion is what keeps you going when nothing else will.</p><p><strong><strong>Absolutely!
