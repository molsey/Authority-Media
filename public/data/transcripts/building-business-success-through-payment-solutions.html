<h2>Colton Page on Smart Payment Solutions</strong></h2><p><strong>I’m doing great. Happy to be here.</p><p>I know this is good. It’s been tough for two busy guys to get together, but I’m excited because here, a lot of the CEOs, owners, and entrepreneurs we talk with love the mindset and lifestyle topics. But at the end of the day, it’s about business. And today, we’re going to feature a topic I haven’t covered before—payments.</strong></p><p>For everyone who doesn’t know Colton, let me give you a quick introduction. Colton Page is the Chief Sales Officer and Co-owner of PlatPay, a cutting-edge merchant processing company with over 20 years of experience. PlatPay has processed over a billion dollars in transactions and is a leader in banking, redundancy, and tailored payment solutions.</strong></p><p>Colton has also been instrumental in securing the company’s largest clients and driving innovation. He holds a dual bachelor’s degree in International Business and Finance, bringing a global perspective to his role. But here’s what’s really interesting—he started as a door-to-door sales rep and grew into managing a team of 40 reps, generating $6 million in sales. His hands-on approach has helped him develop leadership, resilience, and relationship-building skills. He’s passionate about technology and financial systems, which we’ll dive into today. So, welcome to the podcast, man. I appreciate you being here. A lot going on, right?</strong></p><h3>Behind the Scenes of Business Success</strong></h3><p>You know what I love about your industry? You see so many different types of businesses. You kind of have a pulse on what’s working and what’s not. Would you agree?</strong></p><p><strong>I started late—at 25—while I was married and in school. My brother-in-law and I built a team, and over four years, we owned a couple of offices and handled day-to-day operations. It wasn’t just about selling anymore. We were managing technicians, trucks, products, and reps—all while still selling ourselves.</p><p>Wow, so you were managing everything—sales, logistics, operations. That’s a lot.</strong></p><p>Eventually, I realized I loved recruiting and working with the team, but I didn’t want to rely on recruiting 20-year-olds for my financial success. That’s when I pivoted. I had worked at PlatPay before, so I reached out to Jed, my partner. We came up with a strategic plan to build PlatPay together. It’s been a great two-and-a-half years since.</p><p><strong><strong>Absolutely. First, they got me in the door to co-own PlatPay. Second, the discipline and lessons from door-to-door sales are invaluable. I honestly think everyone should try summer sales, even if they’re bad at it.</p><p><strong>Oh, yeah. You figure out your ratio—like, “For every 20 people, I’ll get one sale.” It’s a mental game. But the discipline and tenacity you develop carry over into everything else, from sales to customer service.</p><p>Exactly. Sales often gets a bad rap, but it’s really about communication and persuasion. And those are skills everyone needs. Let’s talk about PlatPay. You’ve been in the payment processing space for a while now. How do you differentiate yourselves in such a competitive market?</strong></p><p>We specialized in high-risk industries like coaching and continuity. Over time, we grew by attending masterminds and building relationships. Unlike other processors who rely on leads or cold outreach, we’ve always focused on relationships and referrals.</p><p><strong><strong>For us, it’s about going beyond just taking payments. We ask, “How can we help your business grow?” If we can add value—whether it’s introducing clients to strategic partners or helping them generate more revenue—it benefits everyone in the long run.</p><p>I love that. By creating value and building trust, you make it less about who’s offering the cheapest deal and more about the relationship. Let’s talk about something you’ve mentioned before: banking redundancy. What does that mean in the context of payment processing, and how does it benefit businesses?</strong></p><p>We work to diversify not just the processors but the banks behind them. This ensures that if one account gets frozen or shut down—due to chargebacks, refunds, or rapid growth—you’re not left stranded. It’s about building a safety net for our clients.</p><p>That’s such an important point, especially for businesses that only think about processing after they run into problems. What are the biggest challenges you see businesses facing when it comes to payment processing?</strong></p><p>If one of those accounts causes an issue, it can trigger an audit that affects everyone. We’ve had clients come to us after realizing they built their entire system around Stripe, only to have their funds frozen. Fixing that after the fact is a heavy lift, involving new integrations and development work.</p><p><strong>Fraud is a big issue, and it’s only getting more sophisticated. We address this at both the gateway and processor levels by using settings and strategies to mitigate risk. For businesses with high transaction volumes or lower dollar thresholds, we recommend specialized chargeback management platforms.</p><h3>Adapting to Rapid Change</strong></h3><p>The financial and payment processing landscape is changing so quickly with AI, blockchain, and emerging technologies. How do you keep up?</strong></p><p>Visa and other processors are adapting as well, and blockchain is continuing to grow in relevance. It’s all about staying ahead by aligning with the right partners and being proactive in adopting new technology.</p><p>Let’s talk about Payment Cowboys. You’ve mentioned it a few times. What is it, and how did it come about?</strong></p><p>The goal was to take our expertise in payment processing and tailor it to a specific audience. Part of our profits go to cowboy charities, so we’re not just providing a service—we’re giving back to the community.</p><p>That’s such a creative approach. You’ve taken a fairly generic product, like payment processing, and turned it into something with a cause and a connection to a specific group. That’s inspiring.</strong></p><h3>Balancing Growth and Relationships</strong></h3><p>You’re growing rapidly, but growth can be tricky. How do you balance scaling your business with maintaining strong relationships with clients?</strong></p><p>Even though we’ve been around for 20 years, I treat PlatPay like a startup. That mindset keeps us focused on growth while ensuring we don’t lose sight of what’s important—our clients.</p><p>When do you know it’s time to expand your team or bring in more resources?</strong></p><p><strong>We have growth goals across three areas: FinTech, operations, and sales. We want to streamline our onboarding process, build stronger banking relationships, and grow niches like Payment Cowboys.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong>‍</p><h4>About Colton Page:</strong><br></h4><h5>Important Links:</strong></h5><p id=""><a href="https://www.platpay.com/">PlatPay Website</strong>:</a></p><p id=""><a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/PlataPay-61559829641515/">PlatPay on Facebook</strong>:&nbsp;</a></p><p id=""><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/platpay">PlatPay on LinkedIn</strong>:</a></p><p id=""><a href="https://www.facebook.com/colton.page.79/">Colton Page on Facebook</strong>:&nbsp;</a></p><p><strong>George Wright is a Proven, Successful Entrepreneur- and he knows how to inspire entrepreneurs, companies, and individuals to achieve Massive Results.
