It is someone who went from being deep in debt and overwhelmed to building a multimillion-dollar coaching business. We are not talking about fluff and any of that stuff. </strong><a href="https://jeanneomlor.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Jeanne</strong></a><strong> is a certified business strategist and online business coach who focuses on helping coaches and consultants, basically high achievers, to be able to create more clarity, profit, and purpose.</strong></p><p><strong>Recently, I got a chance to be on her podcast, and I really got overwhelmed with the idea that she has now, where she really also works with ultra-high-net-worth individuals, CEOs, and founders, and helps them to maximize impact, purpose, and legacy. She has built her success around a powerful concept called the Genius Zone, which we will talk about. What is unique about her is that she scaled fast, hitting seven figures in seventeen months without relying on paid ads. She has an amazing background.</strong></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/695b76181e4d55548e54d5b3_Graphics%20-%20EB%20-%20AIP%20Jeanne%20Omlor.png" loading="lazy" alt="Authority Formula Podcast | Jeanne Omlor | Business Catalyst" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p><a href="https://jeanneomlor.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Jeanne Omlor</strong></a><strong>, I appreciate you being here with us. I am excited to be talking with you.</strong></p><p>George Wright III, I feel honored.</p><h3>Unlocking Your Genius Zone: Definition And Discovery</h3><p><strong>I appreciate that. Listen, I have been around a lot of big names over the years, grown global brands, but you have this unique gift. It is why I think a lot of people bring you into their practices, their businesses, and things to help them because you not only relate, you have got this relatability, but you get results. I want you to just start right out of the shoot with some real big value. I just want you to share with our audience this idea you have that you use called the Genius Zone. Can you define for our listeners what that means and how somebody discovers their Genius Zone?</strong></p><p>Genius zones are nothing new. Let us be real, I did not coin it, but I did realize along the way, when we are in flow, things just work. What is being in flow? Being in flow is not doing something that you are really not good at. You can get good at something. I was not good at business, but I knew I could become good, and I got into a flow with it. I was not a good business person at all. I was a starving artist type of person, and I did not care about money. I do not believe that people should say, "I am not good at that."</p><p>No, you are not good at that yet. You are not good at that because you never tried to be good at it. You are not good at that because it was not something important to you. I am not saying, "Just do what is so easy for you," because that is giving up. A lot of what I am doing, I was not good at. I knew that I could learn it. Once I learned it, I got into a groove. I thought, "Actually, some of this is my genius zone." What I realized is that before I was a business person, I had a gift, and that is helping people make money. I had an identity.</p><p><strong>That is a great gift to have. People love it.</strong></p><p>I think so. People around me literally say, "I made more money this month just because I know you."</p><p><strong>I am curious why, because that is not just a strategy, which you have amazing strategy tactics. Why do you think they felt that? Why do you think they feel that? How important is that?</strong></p><p>It is proximity to people. We were talking about this with a colleague. He said, "Jeanne, most people are not like you." I said, "Really, what do you mean?" He said, "Like you are, they are not upbeat. They are not on people's sides. They are not cheering for people. They are pessimists." He is like this as well. He said, "Me too, because we are like two peas in a pod. We are an anomaly. Pessimistic, just everything." He said, "Positivity is infectious." I thought, “That is true. It is not like I was always like this. I was pretty negative in some ways when I was an actress, and it was like it was not working.” I am not saying I was born this way.</p><h3>The Mindset Shift: Overcoming Anxiety And Negative Beliefs</h3><p><strong>No, and you have been through a lot, like your journey, and not just going from 2,000 a month to 30 to 50 to 100 to scale into multi-millions, but you have also had a lot of shifts in your mindset, your habits, your decisions. Talk about a little bit of that. Talk through your journey of what you went through.</strong></p><p>It is important that you do not just say, "Jeanne, you were like that." No, I was not. I was negative. I was down and out. I was like, "Oh my gosh." I was scared to death, full of anxiety. I struggle with anxiety. Being me is not easy. I have to work on that every single day. I am winning, but it is not like I wake up and I am just like, "I have an anxiety thing." I do not have a disorder, but I struggle, and it is a challenge. I am finding that fight every day. I know what to do now.</p><p><strong>Many people fight that. Many people are dealing with that.</strong></p><p>It is when you realize, one day, I woke up, and I thought, "You mean everybody does not live like this?" I literally did not know that. I went through my whole life until about five years ago, and it dawned on me. "You mean people do not wake up the way I do every day? I thought that was just human life." It is crazy. It took me that long to figure it out. I just thought that was the way people were. I thought, "Wait, I have a thing going on here." It was so strange. It took me so long. I just thought that was the human condition to wake up with anxiety every day, literally.</p><p><strong>What brought you to the point where you realized that was the case? What was the pivot?</strong></p><p>I was observing a family member, and I thought, "Wait, this family member has an issue with anxiety. So do I." We both have a thing, and I said to this family member, and he went, "Yeah, I know." He said it took you long enough to figure it out because you are just going along your life, thinking that everybody thinks this way.</p><blockquote>Success never happens overnight.</blockquote><p>The point is, I think it is very important because I am not here to make people feel bad about themselves, because you know how bad that feels when you listen to successful people, and they have it all together, and you are like, "Yeah, they're them. I'm me. They don't understand me." I do understand you because it was not rosy. I worked very hard to neutralize emotions, understand a lot about mindset, and understand that people have such great value, and it is just sometimes their personality.</p><p>If you do not have a great personality, you can work on that. You do not have charisma. You can work on that. You can work on all of this. There are exercises because I was an actress to actually develop charisma. This thing, this cop out of, "You were born like that." Yes, some people are born like that. I was born with a sunny personality. I was, but then life happened, and I was not so sunny.</p><p><strong>Let us be clear to our audience. You were not originally this high-powered business strategist. You were a fashion designer, an actor, and a recruiter. You had all of these other types of things. You pivoted into this, and I guess it was like at 54, you decided you made a decision to go all in. What did that?</strong></p><p>At 54, I had already been coaching for eight years, by the way. Let us be real. People go, "My goodness, she got online." Not true. Overnight success is never an overnight success. I had been coaching for eight years, doing a lot of things. I was a good coach, and I could get to a certain level, but it was not sustainable, and about networking and more networking and being out there in the world.</p><p>I have kids, and I am a single mom, a solo parent. I just thought, "I need to fix this because I had then been through another life crisis and all my money was vacuumed out of my life and I was again in deep debt." I thought, "This is not working offline. I need to get online." That was the moment that changed it all. I got online, and I figured out how to do business more sustainably.</p><h3>The Pivotal Shift: From Fashion Blogger To Coaching Powerhouse</h3><p><strong>I want to ask you something because you have just made a point that I have some clarity for now. You did two transitional pivots. You went from this career you had into coaching, and I am curious what took you into that besides the fact that you realized that was one of your genius zones. There was this pivot that you had where you leveled up your coaching business, because I know there are a lot of coaches and consultants that are doing this, and they love it. They want to create impact, but they are not making any money. What got you into that industry initially?</strong></p><p>Let us be really transparent here. I had no choice. The first time I found myself with two kids, one year old and one four-year-old, in New York City, with no job and really no income at all. I had the bright idea to start a kids fashion blog, and guess what? Everybody in the world knew about the kids' fashion blog in three months. They loved it. I was great at spreading the word. It got me writing content every single day.</p><p>I showed it, and every day there was a blog post. I was a fashion designer, so I would attract the brands, and they would send me a bunch of free loot. My kids were the best-dressed poor kids in New York City. They had Gotti dresses, all sorts of stuff being sent to us, and I thought, "This is great, but we cannot eat this." We got a lot of loot, and I got a little bit of advertising, and it got me out there, and I was invited to nice parties.</p><p>I was a mini celebrity in the kids' blogging world. People were like, "I love your blog." It felt great. It felt amazing to have recognition at that point. I thought, "It is not really making a lot of money and a little bit of advertising, but that is okay." It got me out there, got me some confidence in writing, and people knew that was good. I really need to create a business that is going to make money. What do I do?</p><p>I wrote down everything possible where I could still stay at home, take care of my kids, and not farm them out because I will not do that. I thought the only thing I could do was coaching. Literally the only thing I can do. I cannot sell houses because I am not going to be out there showing houses. It is not sustainable. I cannot get a job. I thought the only thing that I can do that I am good at, because I used to coach actors and I am good at coaching. I thought this was a fit.</p><p>This is what I am going to do. I got certified at night online in my pajamas when my kids were sleeping to be a life coach. I started getting clients, and it was just word of mouth. That is the first way, but you cannot just keep doing that. I thought, and immediately I started helping people make money because, as I said, I have a gift, and then my coach said, "You are actually a business coach."</p><p>She said, "All of your clients have businesses, and you are helping them make money, and you are figuring out how to market, even though you are a non-marketer, but somehow you know how to do that." I said, “Okay.” It was all about business coaching, and life is always in there anyway. I started speaking gigs and being out there, but it was all about being out there. That is exhausting when you are taking care of two young kids, and I was homeschooling, and I was taking them to all their events. It was a lot. I hardly ever slept. I started getting clients, and I was just grateful that it was working at all. That was great.</p><p><strong>At that point, you had to have been acting as a future version of yourself because it did not sound like you had a lot of confidence in things initially, at least, but as you did more, you gained more traction, momentum, success, and more results. Interestingly, you say that because I know a lot of people, they know what they want to do, but they struggle with doing it because they have imposter syndrome. They do not feel like they know what they are doing. It is interesting to me how you, from the fashion industry, leaned into blogging, something you knew, and leaned into the next thing, which was coaching, because you had to. You have just built from there. It is so much mindset too.</strong></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/695b76740f6e113b4d3f6d88_Graphics%20-%20Host%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Jeanne%20Omlor.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Authority Formula Podcast | Jeanne Omlor | Business Catalyst" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Do you want to hear the secret?</p><p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p>This is the secret. I realized that I had no time to fail. I realized that if I let myself wallow and be that, because I am very sensitive, and it was really hard because there is so much rejection and everything. I had already been through all the rejection of being an actress, so I was already primed. I realized at one point, whenever I doubt, I am losing time, I am not putting food on the table, and I cannot do that.</p><p><strong>I love how you said that there was no time to fail, but you accepted failure as just a stepping stone, so it did not stop you. It was not creating doubt. You were pushing through it anyway. That is so huge.</strong></p><p>What I mean by fail is, of course, I am failing, and I did not get everything. What I meant was I remember these days, and it just felt icky because I was not there yet. I was out there, and I had confidence because people respond very well to me. I had already been a top executive recruiter on Wall Street. I had confidence that I could deal with people. I already had that. I was not doubting that because I had evidence of that.</p><p>However, I had been through a lot of bad stuff, and I just thought, "I am just going to go out and tell people what I do." I was confident when I met people. When I had some sort of setback, usually I would wallow and self-doubt. We talk ourselves off the ledge. I thought, "Now let us just look at this logically because I am big on logic." When I have to talk myself off a ledge, what is happening here? Let me think. There is a time I have to doubt myself, feel bad about myself.</p><p>I put myself through the wringer, and I said to myself, "How long do I usually take to do that?" Good question. Let me see. It could be a week. I do not have a week or two weeks. That is wasting time. What I have to do is I have to learn how to process this in a minute. You know what I did? I figured out a system where I would pretend I would remember the old VHS like forward. I would fast-forward my self-doubt in a few seconds. I would do this. I would go, boom, done. That is how long it took.</p><h3>Be A Catalyst: The Secret To Fast-Forwarding Self-Doubt</h3><p><strong>I love that because you are not saying I avoided it. You are saying I pushed through it faster. That is awesome. What I love about that secret and that track to fast forwarding, and you said a couple of things, I think success leaves clues. At the end of the day, you are an emotional person. A lot of people are emotional people, but you turned it into a logical path that allowed you to push through it faster because you have to push through it faster.</strong></p><p><strong>None of us has time, really. I love how you said that because I think sometimes we do not realize the time we are spending is the problem in pushing forward. I was going to mention to you, you like to refer to yourself as a catalyst. That is a great example of that. I was going to ask you what you mean when you say you go into a business as a catalyst. How do you go into a business or someone who hires you as a catalyst for them and their company?</strong></p><p>Being a catalyst is helping other people have realizations that are just compounding everything. It is not about me saying, "Go do that." It is about, "Did you think of that?" “Actually, no, we did not.” That creates this other flow of ideas. "Did you look into that?" “No. How do you think?” It is not always a question. It is like, "We did not even look at that. We did not even notice that." Great. I think that static way of looking at things.</p><blockquote>Things are not as complex as people like to make them.</blockquote><p>There’s that info, and that’s what you get. Working with people, it is a synergy of creating a compound effect, and a catalyst is that. A catalyst is throwing something somewhere, and it just creates all this stuff happening. I do see myself as a catalyst and a conduit, but a conduit is different from a catalyst. A conduit is just a line.</p><p>A catalyst creates explosions. If you look at what a catalyst means, it can be like a fuse for an explosion. I look at myself as the fuse that explodes things in a good way. I am not God, and it is not all coming from me. I am just a person, and it is about the inspiration of getting people to think and figure it out.</p><p>They are bringing their value in because people that I am coaching know more about what they are doing than I do, because they are the experts. I am just helping them fix stuff around that. I am not helping them be. They could be a better leader, but if I am working with a company and he is the CEO of a tech company, I do not know as much as he does about his tech.</p><p>I am just looking for gaps, like what is going on and why is this not working? Personal life stuff sometimes as well. For the coaches and consultants, clearly, like I have a client who is one of the world's top innovation consultants. He knows way more about me than I do. I am helping him build his business.</p><h3>Purpose Beyond Profit: Maximizing Your Legacy And Impact</h3><p><strong>One of the reasons I really liked that catalyst comment is from two perspectives. One perspective is from a coach or a consultant, or anything in life. A lot of times, people feel like they have to have all the answers when the true benefit is being a catalyst for answers that people have inside them. The other perspective is that most businesses, what they really need more than an expert and a consultant is a catalyst. They need someone to come in and shake it up in a real positive way.</strong></p><p><strong>I wanted to ask you this question because I know we’re limited on time. You work with high-net-worth individuals, CEOs, and founders, but it is to help them maximize their impact, their purpose, and their legacy. That is a piece that, even if you are not to that level, you want to feel like you have an impact. I am wondering how you advise or help individuals to balance profitability in your business with impact and purpose.</strong></p><p>The first thing is that it is really important. Things are not as complex as people like to make them. I think somebody told me, "You are a genius at getting stuff that would be complex and confusing and making it so simple that anybody can understand it, because I am not that smart, and I cannot activate unless it is something I can understand, and just, what do I do?"</p><p>People tell me all this stuff, and I say, "Great. What is the first step?" Silence. If you cannot figure out a first step, you cannot just do stuff. I always say, "What do I do first? What is the first thing I can do?" They cannot tell me. I said, "I need to know how I start. I cannot just vaguely do a bunch of stuff all at once, but people are not good at breaking things down."</p><p>I am good at breaking things down. The first thing we need to figure out is what we deeply desire. What do we really want? Not what we think we want because it makes us feel good. Let us say you say, "I really want to just go buy another sports car, Jeanne." Maybe that is true. You want to buy the sports car, but what do you really want? Maybe you are just a sports car fan. That is possible because you love cars.</p><p>It might be that what you really want is you want people to look at you a certain way. You want people to think, "That is an important guy. He must have a lot of money." “Why?” “It’s because of blah, blah.” When you really look at why we do stuff, the question of what you want is usually it is not the first answer.</p><p><strong>Sometimes you do not know right off the bat either. Somebody has to help pull it out of you.</strong></p><p>That is what I do with that. That is a long conversation. With those high-end people, I fly anywhere in the world, and I spend days with them because it is not going to be in one conference and not every single day, all day, but we will spend a day, take some time off, and meet again. It’s cooking. There is a lot of realization that happens when you get very deep about what you really want. I thought, “You really want to make more money? Really?”</p><blockquote>If your money is your whole life and you lose it overnight, then that means you have no life.</blockquote><p>At a certain point, people make a lot of money, and they do not really need to make more. It is just sports. That is when you are going up Maslow's hierarchy, when you get to a point where all your needs are taken care of. You can do whatever you want. You can travel wherever you want. You can go to any restaurant.</p><p>You can buy any clothes. That is where the emptiness really starts to set in. What do we do now? That is when people start getting into bad behaviors because they need more of a thrill. Does that make sense? People who always need a new thrill are empty inside. Just thrill upon thrill, that is when you have to really think about "What is my purpose here? How do I actually create impact?" I do not really like that word, but there is no other word for it but make a difference. A bad difference or a big difference. A lot of bad people made a big difference.</p><p>I also hate that. "I just want to make a difference." I always say to myself, "A bad or good one?" It is a lot of platitudes and cliches, but that aside, we need to figure out "How do I want to be?" not "What do I want to do?" How do I want to be as a human being? What do I do? How do I want to feel about myself? I am going to feel like I woke up, and it is just that I made money and made people miserable, and I did not help people. Most people want to feel like they have helped other people if they are normal human beings.</p><p><strong>Those emotions are what we are really looking for. We are just trying to get the profits and everything else to be able to help us get those. You do not need to have those to get them. I love what you are saying, because I think at a high level, that is a challenge I think a lot of founders, CEOs, and ultra-high net worth individuals struggle with. I think if you, even at a lower level, begin to ask yourself those questions, why and what is it you are really trying to create? What do you want your life to be like? Those will navigate you down a path that might be slightly different than what you are going down, but do it and be able to do both. That is a big key.</strong></p><p>The fact is, if we lose our money, which we can overnight, and that is your whole life, that means you have no life. Money can be lost. You really want to make sure that you are developing all this other stuff. "I lost the money, but that is okay because I am a good person. I am a good parent, and I have friends, and I help people." Not good, and it is upsetting, but you are not committing suicide like a lot of people did when they lost their money because that was their whole life. People with purpose do not commit suicide when they lose their money.</p><h3>Final Advice: Stop Making Excuses And Start Today</h3><p><strong>I also want to leave a couple of key messages around what you just said, because I think not only do you need to determine what it is and why you want to do it, but I think it is never too late to start creating the life that you want to live, or it is never too late to start aligning your impact and your purpose with your fulfillment and your business. I really like that. I wish we had a ton of time.</strong></p><p><strong>I am going to ask you to come back and speak to our academy. Before I do, I want to just ask you two final questions. What would be your advice in the current market for people who are trying to level up? Is there anything in particular that just comes to mind for you for any way that you would like to leave our audience with? How can they get a hold of you? How can they get in touch with you?</strong></p><p>Let us talk about the coaches and consultants, because that is actually my bread and butter. Do not wait. Stop listening to the news. Stop listening to everybody. Stop making excuses. Stop using the excuses as an excuse that "The economy and this president or that president," because I hear that every single time there is any president, quite frankly.</p><p>Just do it because every moment that you are waiting, you are wasting precious time, and you are never going to get that back. As I said, you can lose your money and can make it back again, a hundred millionfold. You cannot get time back. Stop the excuses, whether they are conscious or really get clear on whether the excuses are because everybody has a million excuses for why they do not do stuff. I never used excuses ever.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68d5682d0bff244bd393dea8/695b76851e4d55548e5506a1_Graphics%20-%20Guest%20Square%20-%20AIP%20Jeanne%20Omlor.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Authority Formula Podcast | Jeanne Omlor | Business Catalyst" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>I did not even know what was going on with politics most of the time because I had my head down. I was just focused on "I need to support my kids, and I need to make this work." That is it. I did not go, "I read the news, and I cannot do that because of this." That is a gift when you are blind to what is going on sometimes, because you just function. Figure out what you want? If you want to make money helping other people as a coach or consultant, a business person, or whatever, just do it. I think somebody else said that.</p><p><strong>Yes, for sure. No, I love it. It is great advice. It is one that everyone needs to stop listening to and do. Just literally stop hearing it and actually take action on it. What is the best place for them to get a hold of you? What is the best place for someone to be able to connect with you?</strong></p><p>My website is <a href="http://jeanneomlor.com/" target="_blank">JeanneOmlor.com</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanneomlor/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p><strong>If you are listening to this, I would really recommend and encourage you to connect and reach out. I think using the term catalyst was really a great idea. There might be something that just takes you to the next level, pushes you to the next. I really appreciate you being here with us. There is so much more. I wish we had more time because there is so much more that we could share, and you have such a depth of experience.
