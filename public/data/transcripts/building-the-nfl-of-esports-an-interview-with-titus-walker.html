<h1>Building the NFL of eSports: An Interview with Titus Walker</strong></h1><p><strong>Hey, thanks for having me, man. Thank you so much.</p><p>This is good. Listen, I know we had a chance to talk a little bit beforehand, but I think we're gonna get into some cool stuff. Before we do, I want to give them a little bit of your background. Titus is the CEO and founder of the Ultimate End Gamer League (UEL). His goal is for that to be the NFL of eSports.</strong></p><p>But you’ve got a pretty diverse background. You've gone from real estate to gaming to starting your own company, growing a community, and creating a brand. We're gonna get into all of that. I really love what you've done in a very short period of time, so you’ve got some great nuggets I'm sure you can share with our audience. So once again, super glad to have you here, man.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Titus Walker's Background and Early Hustles</strong></h3><p>I always like to give our audience a little bit of a framework for the success that you and I touched on. So help us understand where you came from, right? You mentioned that you've been in real estate and then you went into this. Let's just start real quick with Titus's background. Did you grow up like a side hustle type of guy? Where did you come from and how did you get into real estate?</strong></p><p>Fast forward to elementary school, I was selling candy bars. I found out you could buy candy bars in bulk, and I'm doing the math in my head and talking to my mom like, "Hey, we can sell these for a lot more and make a lot of money." She would take me to the store, and I’d buy a bunch of candy bars and sell them.</p><p>That's funny you say that. I was just at dinner last night talking to buddies about how I used to buy those boxes of candy bars at school. I'd have 'em in my duffel bag, and I'd just always be the guy like, "Yeah, you need something to eat? Here you go." Constantly all the time. That's funny. Okay, keep going.</strong></p><p>I don't even know what the sickness was, but I got really sick. While I was sick, I was thinking a lot because I was in the hospital. I realized I wanted to try something different. I happened to get an email saying a company was hiring, and it was a real estate developer. I had never heard of it, but I figured I'd put myself out there. I went to an interview, got hired, and that transitioned me into the real estate world. I did really well—hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue over my eight-year career.</p><p><strong>I think in everything I've ever done, I spend a lot of time understanding the industry and the people around the industry. Nowadays, you really can find out anything you ever want to know, whether it's true or not, online. Once that concept hit me—oh, I can find this somewhere—it changed everything.</p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Curiosity and Transition to Gaming</strong></h3><p>From what you told me earlier, it’s probably another reason that you went into gaming. Your curiosity and exposure to people and things put you out there to be aware of opportunities. So tell us a little bit about what took you into gaming. I know people think, “I want to make money gaming,” and then think, “Oh my gosh, dude.” But nowadays, it's legit, right? What was the transition point? Were you thinking, “Is this even possible?” or, “I got this”? What was the transition?</strong></p><p>I started a trading company and poured money into other businesses, trying to make them work. But none of them drove me. I’d try something because I needed to, but eventually, something clicked. When I started the gaming arcade idea and really researched it, something felt different. It was clear the industry had serious needs, but it was also broken.</p><p>Let me stop you for a second because I think people need to really understand the point you just made. People are so busy living their lives, they aren’t looking to prepare themselves. That’s the first point. The second is they say, “I don’t know what I want to do,” and you’re saying you just started trying things—trading, investing, whatever. You were looking. Do you feel you would’ve even come across gaming if you hadn’t been out there looking?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah, it was more that I wanted to continue to grow. I’m addicted to progress—addicted to it. If I don’t see progress, I struggle. I even have this daily game I play because it’s about progress. It’s 10 minutes in the morning, but it gives me that little sense of accomplishment and fuels my day.</p><p>You literally have a game you do every day to give you that progress? That’s cool. I’m going to need more details on that! But let’s go back—you said you came across gaming. Was it a passion first or the opportunity? What drew you to it?</strong></p><p>That’s exactly it. Every other gaming competition is one game. So I started thinking, “Why on earth would I focus on just one game when gamers play an average of 24 games a year?” It didn’t make sense. I dove deeper into the research and realized there was an entire untapped opportunity.</p><p><strong><strong>Exactly. I didn’t go out and say, “How do I create the UEL?” I said, “How did the NBA, NFL, and MLB start? How did they create a new industry?” Because that’s what they did. The NBA owns basketball. If they change a rule, the entire sport changes. Same with the NFL and football. They control their industries.</p><p><strong>It was tough. I spent three years convincing people. Everyone told me I was wrong. They said, “This will never work. Just do it the way everyone else does.” But I kept going. I focused on building a community first.</p><p><strong>Gaming has never been seen as an art form, but I believe it is. It’s a form of expression. How you play a game reflects your personality and creativity. eSports doesn’t allow for that. There are rigid rules—play this way or it doesn’t count.</p><p><strong>It was hard. But I believed in what I was building. I felt peace about it, even during the tough times. My business partners backed out. My job gave me an ultimatum. I lost $150,000 a year for three years. But I never wavered.</p><p>Wow. That kind of commitment is rare. So now you’ve built the UEL. Tell us, where is it today? What’s the vision?</strong></p><p><strong>You have to commit. Decide that you’re going to do it no matter what. Don’t dabble. Don’t wait for the perfect plan. Just start. And don’t let the doubts stop you. Keep going, even when it’s hard.</p><p><strong><strong>You can follow us on all social media or visit our website at uelesports.com. That’s U-E-L-eSports.com. We’re also on Instagram and Discord.
