<h2>‍</p><p><strong>I’m doing great. Thanks. How are you, George?</p><p>Good, good. I’m glad that we’re able to coordinate. A lot of times busy entrepreneurs, it’s difficult, but we are going to get into some really good stuff today. It goes along the lines with several conversations I’ve been having with some of my mentoring clients lately.</strong></p><h3><strong><strong>Yeah, thanks for asking that, George. So interestingly enough, my mom had decided unanimously to become a Buddhist nun after listening to a lecture by our Buddhist master. Even though my dad had begged her to stay, once she makes up her mind—it’s made. The funny thing is, she asked her friend to take care of my dad, meaning be his wife. That’s a whole other story, but wow, that lady did end up becoming my stepmom—not right away, though. It was crazy, unheard of.</p><p><strong>Yeah. So growing up in the monastery, living among monks and nuns, it was quite different. It was all about detaching from worldly desires and living a simple life—no internet, no shopping, no distractions. It was almost like an Amish community.</p><p>Transition to Business and Personal Development</h3><p>It’s interesting though that even with that background, you went right into business. You’ve had a lot of success in several industries—from telecom to sales and support—and you’ve been featured in Valiant CEO because of a major pivot you made. I’d like to know what your perspective is on overall wellness and mindset, both physical and mental. What was the reason you decided to go down that path?</strong></p><p>It gave me language to unpack the things that were “running the show,” if you will. Everything that happens—human beings are meaning-making machines—we make a story out of it. Sometimes we don’t let go of those stories, and they end up driving our lives without us realizing it.</p><p><em><strong>Yeah, I would say businesses focused on developing their people into leaders. Some business owners still maintain that top-down, command-and-control structure—they just want employees to follow orders. That’s not who I serve. I work with business owners who want to develop people and leaders—both in themselves and in their teams.</p><blockquote>“Leadership isn’t about control—it’s about creating more leaders. Empowered people create empowered results.”</em></blockquote><h3><strong>Yeah, I would say start at the root level. But before dealing with the root, you want to begin with the end in mind, which is one of <em>When we talk about what we want our lives to look like, it’s about designing from imagination—not memory. Don’t base it on what’s “realistic” from your past experiences, because that’s limiting. Once you have that vision, you need to look at the root—what’s actually getting in the way of fulfilling that?</p><p><strong><strong>‍</p><p>Three-Step Transformation Process</h3><p>The first step is <strong>For me, I realized I had a pattern of procrastination—constantly waiting until the last minute. I’d justify it, telling myself I was just making the most of my time.</p><p>Yeah, we rationalize it, huh?</strong></p><p>She called me out, and we unpacked it. I discovered that story came from when I was twelve years old, living as a Buddhist monk. We were visiting the headquarters monastery in Ukiah, California, and during an evening lecture with hundreds of people, one of the monks asked if someone from our novice group would come on stage to recite a Sanskrit mantra from memory. I volunteered.</p><p>“I’m a failure. No matter what I do or how hard I try, I’ll always be a failure.”</em></p><p>getting complete with the past</strong>. Because as I often say, <em>What was happening was like tripping over the same chair I kept placing in front of myself.</p><p>Exactly. Most people don’t even recognize that themselves. That’s why mentors help so much. Okay, so you’re uncovering your story—keep going.</strong></p><p>Getting complete means letting go of those old meanings—freeing yourself to start fresh.</p><p>inventing new possibilities.</strong></p><p>invent</em> because we’re not talking about wishful thinking like “I want to be rich.” That comes from lack—from effect, not cause. Instead, we become the cause. That aligns with the natural law of <em>Society often teaches the reverse—<em>Look at innovators like Thomas Edison—he didn’t see his early failures as mistakes. He said, “I found a thousand ways not to make a light bulb.”</p><p>Yeah. It sounds subtle, but it’s not. It makes a huge difference in your performance.</strong></p><p>become</em> the person first—embody that mindset—it dictates your actions and effectiveness. The results naturally follow. There’s no shortage of money in the world, only a shortage of ideas. If you want to elevate your wealth, elevate your thinking and your mindset.</p><p>Yeah, I love that. So let me get this right—it’s uncover your story, get complete with your past, and invent new possibilities. And I like that it ties to identity, because most people operate from their past. But even in the present, it’s hard to do the things you want unless you first <em>‍</p><p>Daily Rituals and Consistency</h3><p>Do you have particular daily rituals or protocols you use to stay consistent personally?</strong></p><p>The Miracle Morning</em> by Hal Elrod, definitely read it. He even has an app called <em>Starting your morning that way elevates your mindset before you even begin your day.</p><p>Yeah, I think winning the morning is key to winning the day. I’ve learned that too. And if you don’t create consistency, even after breakthrough moments, you can slip back into complacency or false productivity. Just being <em>productive.</em> That’s great advice, and that book suggestion is solid. I really appreciate you spending time here.</strong></p><h3><strong>First, LinkedIn. I’m pretty active there—you can find me by typing <em>LinkedIn.com/in/MrCharisma.</em></p><p>Mr. Charisma, nice! What’s the story behind that?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah. What I’d say is: find inner peace before trying to figure out what to do externally. The outside world reflects the inner world. If you don’t have it figured out inside, everything outside will feel chaotic.</p><p>vision casting, storytelling, assignments, and challenge.</strong></p><p>Because what you resist, persists. The more you avoid it, the more it controls you. Face your weaknesses, and turn them into your strengths.</p><p>Yeah, that’s great advice. Most of our listeners are leaders, and that’s exactly what they need to be hearing. This has been an amazing conversation, Charlie. For everyone listening, I’ll put the links to connect with Charlie in the show notes. I encourage you to reach out.</strong></p><p>One thing I always say—no matter where you are or what you’re doing—it’s never too late to start living the life you’re meant to live. Sometimes it’s just one connection away. One strategy away. One decision away.</strong></p><p>Charlie, thank you again for joining us, and to our listeners, we appreciate you tuning in.
