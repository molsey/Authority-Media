<h2>‍</p><p>Welcome back to The Authority Formula Podcast. George Wright III here with your daily dose of inspiration, motivation, and education. If this is your first time listening, you’re in for a treat. We’ve got an amazing guest here today. I don’t do a ton of interviews, but we’re going to roll out some more, and this one is really special.</strong></p><p>I’ve handpicked someone who I feel will bring incredible value to you today. Our podcast is all about masterminding—bringing together people who think alike, people who want to evolve and take their lives to the next level. Nicole, who I’m about to introduce, is the perfect example of that. Let me give her a quick introduction before we dive in.</strong></p><p>Nicole Kernohan is a high-performance coach and the Chief Operating Officer of a rather large coaching company. I chose her to come on the podcast today because she trains and empowers entrepreneurs to scale their lives, create breakthroughs, and drive transformation. Not only that, but she also understands the systems and processes needed to make it happen.</strong></p><p>We’re going to dig into a lot of her background and strategies today. Nicole Kernohan, how are you? Welcome to the show.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</p><h3>Nicole's Personal Journey with MS</strong></h3><p>I had an episode where I became paralyzed on the right side of my body—my right arm and leg. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). It completely knocked me off track. I was young, and it came out of nowhere.</p><p>But here’s the thing: I heard the diagnosis, but I did not accept the prognosis. The prognosis was their expectation of my potential outcome with this disease. My family thought I was naive. They assumed I didn’t understand the doctor or that I was in denial.</p><p>But because I refused to accept their prognosis, I did whatever it took. I sought advice from nutritionists, naturopaths, and medical practitioners. I never hit a point where I thought, “I’ve done everything; nothing is going to work.”</p><h3>Mindset and Overcoming Obstacles</strong></h3><p>That’s a huge story. I want to highlight something for our listeners. Everyone faces major obstacles—maybe not as significant as an MS diagnosis, but obstacles nonetheless. What really stands out to me is that it’s not about the obstacle itself; it’s about how you respond to it.</strong></p><p>Stephen Covey talks about the space between stimulus and response, where we can choose how to act. You chose to be proactive. You didn’t listen to the naysayers. You chose to find solutions—through fitness, nutrition, and whatever else it took. But I’m curious, were you always a naturally positive person, or was there something in your upbringing or environment that shaped that mindset?</strong></p><p>But, you know what else? I realized something just now. I also did martial arts for ten years before my MS diagnosis. That training created a mental toughness and a “mind-over-body” mindset. I didn’t fully understand it at the time, but those years of programming prepared me for challenges like this.</p><p>Wow, that’s an incredible insight. Martial arts gave you that mental toughness early on. A lot of people don’t realize the foundational things they’ve done in their lives that prepare them for the bigger obstacles ahead.</strong></p><h3>Transition to Business and Entrepreneurship</strong></h3><p>You mentioned martial arts, your positive mindset, and finding solutions. Those elements clearly shaped your response to MS. But your health journey eventually transitioned into entrepreneurship. Take us through that pivot—how did you go from focusing on health and nutrition to running a business?</strong></p><p>I wanted to transform people’s health, just like I had transformed mine. At the time, I thought it was my life’s purpose. But what I realized fairly quickly—and ignored for a while, maybe out of persistence or stubbornness—was that I could give people all the tools they needed, but many wouldn’t follow through.</p><p>You mentioned that to me before, and it stuck with me. People know what to do, but there’s a gap between knowing and doing. Why do you think that is?</strong></p><p><strong>It happened by chance. I stumbled into positive psychology through a three-day seminar with Bob Proctor. That seminar was life-changing.</p><p>It also gave me tools to help others address the deeper issues—the limiting beliefs, fears, and hesitations that were holding them back. Positive psychology became the missing link between knowing and doing.</p><p><strong><strong><strong>It all comes down to subconscious programming. Studies show that 93–97% of our actions are driven by the subconscious mind, not the conscious mind.</p><p>Their autopilot is set to keep them stuck. And most of that programming happens early in life, through childhood experiences and societal conditioning. That’s why so many people struggle—they’re trying to consciously change something, but their subconscious mind is working against them.</p><p>That’s such an important insight. And I think a lot of people listening might feel overwhelmed by the idea of reprogramming their subconscious mind. But I know you have practical strategies and tips for getting started. Can you share a few?</strong></p><p><li>Morning Routine:<br></strong>The first 10–15 minutes of your day are critical. When you wake up, your mind is highly impressionable. If you don’t consciously choose how to start your day, you’ll likely default to the thoughts and feelings of yesterday.<br>Use this time to practice gratitude, meditate, or visualize your goals. Avoid checking your email or social media first thing in the morning—it pulls you into autopilot mode. Instead, set a positive tone for the day with intentional habits.</li><li>Repetition:<br></strong>Repetition is key to reprogramming the subconscious mind. If you hear an inspiring message or read something impactful, don’t just consume it once. Listen to it repeatedly. Read it every day. Repetition helps embed new beliefs and ideas into your subconscious.<br>For example, if you find a podcast or an audio message that empowers you, listen to it daily. Over time, it will become part of your mental framework, and you’ll start to internalize those empowering thoughts.</li></ol><p><strong><strong>Thank you, George.
