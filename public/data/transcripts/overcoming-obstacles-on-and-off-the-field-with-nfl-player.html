<h2>Overcoming Obstacles On and Off the Field with NFL Player with Bronson Kaufusi</strong></h2><p><strong>The Authority Formula Podcast</em>! I’m your host, George Wright III here. Today, I’m joined by a special guest, Bronson Kaufusi. How are you doing, man?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah, I’m excited to share my story and some cool experiences.</p><p><strong><strong>Sure! My dad moved here from Tonga when he was nine years old. He grew up playing rugby, but his high school football coaches saw him playing rugby with his brothers and told him he should try football. He started playing and kicked off the whole football world for my family.</p><p>So it became a family legacy?</strong></p><p><strong>Not at first. It wasn’t until high school that it hit me—football could pay for college. That was all I thought about at the time. But then in college, I realized I could get drafted into the NFL. Every level opened my eyes to new possibilities.</p><p>If your dad was a coach, did you grow up with a really disciplined structure? Was it like, “No shortcuts, earn everything?”</strong></p><h3>High School and College Football Experience</strong></h3><p>It sounds like you thrived on that challenge.</strong></p><p><strong>For sure. I was so conditioned to success principles and daily rituals that it felt natural. But people don’t always realize the structure and discipline behind it—it’s a lot of hard work that just looks effortless from the outside.</p><p><strong><strong>Draft night is the high of highs. You get the call, “This is the Baltimore Ravens, we’re drafting you right now.” It’s surreal—your family is ecstatic, and you feel on top of the world. But fast forward 100 days, and I’m lying on the ground with a dislocated ankle and a spiral fracture in my leg.</p><p>How did that happen?</strong></p><h3>Mindset Training and Overcoming Injury</strong></h3><p>How did you start to recover mentally?</strong></p><p><strong>Oh, 100%. If I hadn’t been training my mindset before I needed it, it would have been so much harder to recover. Instead, I focused on what I could do to get better.</p><p>What other practices helped you stay positive?</strong></p><h3>Discovering New Opportunities</strong></h3><p>You eventually transitioned into business and investing. How did that shift happen?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah, it made me realize that the ceiling I thought existed was invisible. <em>‍</p><h3>Transitioning to Business and Real Estate</strong></h3><p>Was it intimidating to dive into something new like real estate?</strong></p><p><strong>Absolutely. Successful people are usually willing to share their knowledge if you’re willing to ask. Being teachable opens so many doors.</p><p><strong><strong>I want to help young athletes with mindset training and create an ecosystem that includes parents and coaches. Sports teach so many lessons—discipline, resilience, teamwork—that can be applied to life beyond the field.</p><p>Why focus on young athletes?</strong></p><h3>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>This has been such an inspiring conversation.
