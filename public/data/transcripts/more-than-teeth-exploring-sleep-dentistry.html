<h2>More Than Teeth: Exploring Sleep Dentistry with Mike Bennett</strong></h2><p><strong>I'm doing really well and happy to be here.</p><p>Yeah, this is really good. I know we've been talking a bunch over the last little while, and I know you're heading on a trip out to Japan. But before we really get going, I want to do a quick introduction for those of you that are joining us.</strong></p><p>First of all, if you haven’t yet, make sure you like and subscribe to the podcast. You don’t want to miss any of these amazing interviews we're doing—especially as we’re launching the </strong><a href="https://www.authoritymedianetwork.com/">Authority Formula Podcast</strong></a><strong id=""> in our joint venture with </strong><a href="https://valiantceo.com/">Valiant CEO Magazine</strong></a><strong><strong>‍</p><h3>Mike Bennett's Background and Journey</strong></h3><p>It’s about helping people to breathe, sleep, and heal through airway-focused care. With a PhD in healthcare profession education, he really empowers dentists, clients, and the general public to understand the critical link between oral health and whole-body wellness, which is really unique.</p><p>I really love that extra full-body focus, because everyone knows here at the podcast, I’m all about mind, body, money, business, and lifestyle. But you have a mission to transform the lives of both dentists and individuals—is that right?</strong></p><p><strong>Okay, yeah, that’s a great question. I’ve pondered a lot about that, and I think it has a lot to do with my early days.</p><p>Before that experience, I had shadowed a dentist and got my feet wet a little bit. I should say, my hands wet.</p><p>Your hands wet—not really dental humor. It’s better when you’re under the influence of nitrous. It’s a lot better. Hey, we should be doing this podcast with a little…</strong></p><p><strong>Next time.</p><p>But along the way, I had these feelings of, “I want the whole body—I want to understand the whole body. I want to understand how it heals itself.” I was really torn between dental school and medical school. Even all the way through dental school—until my third year—I wasn’t completely sold on being a dentist.</p><p>Long story short, I went into dentistry, didn’t realize what I didn’t know, and found out that as dentists, we are the experts in the oral area.</p><p>You only live three minutes without it, and if you don’t, you get brain damage and keep living. That’s not a good thing.</p><p><strong>And so I realized, if I could somehow enhance the function of the human upper airway, then the body itself could be its own physician. It could work on itself, repair itself, heal itself. Because while we sleep, our bodies are healing—or at least they should be. And the body is amazingly resilient.</p><p>And so I was excited to realize that at some point.</p><p>“That crown you put in—it’s broken.”</p><p>And of course, those were exactly the questions I was asking myself. Then I realized—wait a minute—if I’m doing a good job, which I felt I was, and my labs were top-notch as well, what’s going on in the body to create forces strong enough to break a really hard substance like zirconia or porcelain?</p><p><strong>...standing on a one-inch section of your mouth and expecting that crown not to break.</p><p>So wait—first of all, by the way, I had never thought about the idea that dental work was more than just “I gotta get my teeth maintained.” That’s a huge point. And I know you had a dental practice for a long period of time. It sounds like this was one of those pivot points, like a lot of people have, where they realize there’s actually more going on.</strong></p><p>So I also didn’t realize it affected your dental work as well. So you were seeing people having issues coming back. Is that kind of when things transitioned—or... Help us understand. Because I know you had a practice, went into a specialty, and kind of came back. Is this what shifted you into the area of sleep dentistry?</strong></p><p>Over those first 12 years of practice, I noticed all of these oral signs: worn-down teeth, broken teeth, lots of gum recession, periodontal disease, bone loss, sensitive teeth to hot/cold/sweets... all of those things—teeth in general just breaking down—were linked to chronic, poor sleep.</p><p>So that led from one thing to another—traveling the country and even outside the country looking for experts who knew what they were talking about. I met some wonderful people over the years.</p><p>So after 12 years, I specialized—then spent 10 years (so my 22nd year in practice) just doing full-time sleep disorders, chronic pain, headaches, jaw disorders, popping/clicking, TMJ-type things—and having an airway focus through all of that.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong>I was early on, yes—but it had actually been around for a number of years. In the 1960s, they were already talking about it. It just didn’t reach the mainstream until—I’d say—the 1990s.</p><p><strong>Yes, you just pointed out one of my weaknesses right there.</p><p>What’s that?</strong></p><p>Some people are just like, “Just fix my teeth.”</p><p>Yeah—just, you’re a dentist. Worry about my teeth and gums. That’s all I want from you.</strong></p><p>There are times when I come back from a seminar, or I’ve been reading a book, and I’m excited about telling someone, “Hey, the signs I’m seeing in your mouth—those are risk factors for sleep. There’s a possible sleep disorder. Are you interested in being further screened to see if there’s a problem?”</p><p>So sometimes when I bring it up, it’s like I just called them a name or something.</p><p>Yeah, they take it personally.</strong></p><p>But... your teeth are worn down. You have gum disease. You get cavities every time you come in. You’re flossing, brushing... but they still come.</p><p>There is some pressure. But...</p><p><strong><strong>Yeah—children especially are poignant, but adults as well. One child I worked with was a 9-year-old boy from out of state. He’d actually fly into Utah with his mom to get work done.</p><p>He was a recluse. Didn’t want to go out. Didn’t hang out with friends or socialize. He didn’t have a lot of energy.</p><p>We worked on him. We put him in a device, and in the first 30 days—just helping him breathe through his nose and open up his airway—he stopped bedwetting.</p><p>Really? Stopped bedwetting? And it was all because of his airway?</strong></p><p>It’s the compensations the body goes through when the airway is pinched or compromised. For example, if you hold your breath, your heart starts pounding. Your blood pressure goes up. Your brain says, “Hey, get rid of this pressure,” so it tells your kidneys to dump it.</p><p><strong>Yep, absolutely.</p><p>So it’ll do things like empty your bladder. Or take energy away from your digestive system—so you’re not digesting your food well. You get more gas, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea.</p><p><strong>Yep.</p><p>Do you have another example? I know you mentioned adults as well. I would’ve never guessed bedwetting was that significant—but clearly, it changed his life.</strong></p><p>I called his mother a few months after we had finished treatment—about 15 months total—and she said, “It’s just amazing what my boy is doing.”</p><p>He’s a new person. A student leader in school. His mom is so excited. She always knew this boy was there—but he couldn’t sleep, because he couldn’t breathe. And he was having tissue issues and all kinds of problems.</p><p><strong><strong>Yeah—a couple.</p><p>Her employer worked with her for a while, but eventually said, “We’ve got to have someone we can count on.”</p><p>We created a plan to help her establish better breathing so her sleep could improve. We also did some things to help her jaw and facial muscles.</p><p><strong>Yeah—absolutely. Other doctors. Chiropractors. Physical therapists. ENT specialists. Allergy doctors. Physicians. The list goes on. Even GI doctors.</p><p><strong><strong>‍</p><h3>Common Symptoms and Self-Diagnosis</strong></h3><p>What are some of the more common symptoms people should look out for—especially if they’re not thinking “sleep disorder”? Are there signs people should be watching for?</strong></p><p>Beyond the mouth signs—like worn teeth, gum recession, and dry mouth—there are physical signs like bags under the eyes.</p><p>Let me pause and highlight this for our listeners: receding gums, bad teeth... those can actually be symptoms of sleep issues?</strong></p><p>And the tongue is a window to your airway. If you stick out your tongue in the mirror and see imprints from your teeth along the sides, it means your tongue doesn’t have enough room in the mouth.</p><p><strong>Exactly. It’s a big muscle that can plop right back into the airway. The signs—like scalloped edges or indentations from the teeth—show that the tongue is being compressed.</p><p>There are other signs too: daytime sleepiness, not dreaming at night, waking up unrefreshed, dragging yourself out of bed after 8 hours of sleep. An average adult should get 7–8 hours. The younger you are, the more sleep you need. Infants need 18 hours a day.</p><p>And sometimes it feels like the opposite—the older I get, the more I need to sleep. But I get what you’re saying. It varies.</strong></p><p>If you’re snoring, you’re breathing—but if it’s loud, it’s challenged breathing. That’s highly correlated with sleep apnea.</p><p>Now I know you’ve mentioned before that you personally had some sleep challenges. Was that something you discovered while learning about all of this—or was it what led you to it?</strong></p><p>I did fine in school, but I always felt like, “I could do better than this.”</p><p><strong>Yeah, good question.</p><p>If it’s pinched while you’re sleeping for more than 10 seconds, and if your oxygen drops at least 3% each time—that’s considered one sleep apnea event.</p><p><strong>Exactly.</p><p>But is your normal really normal?</p><p>I never got into energy drinks, but I used to take naps all through my 30s and 40s, just trying to function.</p><p>So as you looked back, did you realize these issues started even earlier in your life?</strong></p><p>That was the traditional way to treat crowding: remove teeth.</p><p>The genetic code for human beings codes for 32 teeth. If you don’t have 32 teeth, your jaws are likely underdeveloped genetically.</p><p><strong><strong>Exactly. It’s almost worn like a badge of honor: “I’m tired because I’m grinding.”</p><p><strong>Absolutely—100%.</p><p>But you’re trying to do it on four cylinders, when your engine was designed for eight.</p><p>That’s a great analogy. And it’s crazy that people accept that as normal.</strong></p><p>And I’m sure—one of the things I want to make sure we do with this episode—is include links in the show notes to your website and newsletter. Because I think our goal here is to create awareness.</strong></p><p>You've already helped listeners recognize potential symptoms and think about diagnoses. But let’s talk treatment for a minute—because people hear “sleep apnea” and think it automatically means oral surgery or a CPAP machine. What are some of the typical treatment options—home remedies, professional treatments, or what you’d recommend depending on the situation?</strong></p><p>One of the earliest conditions we often treat is snoring. Usually, it’s the wife coming in saying, “Hey, can you fix my husband? I can’t sleep in the same bed anymore.”</p><p>There are products out there—like Mute nasal dilators—that are inserted into the nostrils. There are magnetic nasal strips you place across the nostrils to help open up airflow. They’re kind of like those Breathe Right strips athletes wear.</p><p>So you can start with things like that.</p><p>Keeping your nose clean is a great way to help with breathing.</p><p>Wow. I never even thought about that—nasal hygiene as a thing. Makes total sense. What about once it moves into more clinical territory?</strong></p><p>When used alongside some simple exercises to tone the tongue muscle, that tongue will start to stay put during sleep.</p><p><strong><strong>Yeah, and let me just add: Stephen Covey talks about sharpening the saw.</p><p>I had a woman with chronic migraines who wanted to go on a service trip with her husband but couldn’t. Once we got her breathing corrected, she was able to go to Germany and serve. It was awesome to see that.</p><p>That’s powerful. But I’m guessing CPAP is still the most common go-to for sleep apnea, right?</strong></p><p>But it’s a mask worn over a very sensitive part of your body—your face—and strapped to your head. It’s very difficult for many people to tolerate.</p><p>Even oral appliances aren’t perfect—there’s about a 30% drop-off rate after a year.</p><p><strong>Exactly.</p><p><strong>He didn’t change anything else. Just started breathing better—and his metabolism kicked in. His body began working like it was designed to.</p><p>I love that. Because I think most people just assume they’re tired and need more sleep. So they try to rest more or manage their stress—but they’re not fixing the real problem.</strong></p><p>I’m curious—because clearly, you’re doing things very differently than most dentists—where do you think the future of this is going? Beyond awareness, is the technology advancing? Are there better tools or methods coming that make this all easier?</strong></p><p>For example, let’s say you came in and were diagnosed with sleep apnea. If you didn’t want a CPAP machine, I’d suggest an oral appliance—but traditionally, you’d have to wait four weeks to get one made.</p><p>Now, we’re beta testing technology where dentists can 3D print devices right in the office. Same day.</p><p><strong>Exactly.</p><p><strong>Mostly my colleagues right now—dentists who want to implement screening and treatment strategies into their practice.</p><p>But we’ve also created materials specifically for parents and families—simplified guides to help them know what to look for and where to go for help.</p><p>I love that. Because this mission you’re on—it’s not just about helping dentists grow professionally. It’s about giving families better health, better energy, better quality of life.</strong></p><p>What’s the best way for people to connect with you? Whether they’re a dentist, healthcare provider, or parent looking for answers?</strong></p><p><strong>It is—but we try to write it in a way that works for both healthcare providers and the general public. It’s a 3- to 5-minute read with clear, practical takeaways—bite-sized and easy to digest.</p><p>Yeah, it’s really well done. So let me wrap with this: is there one last recommendation, idea, or strategy you’d give to the average person listening right now? Something they can do today to impact their health?</strong></p><p>Take ownership of your health. If you don’t, who will?</p><p>Talk with your healthcare provider. Make sure you feel good about your care. If you don’t—keep asking questions, keep looking. Your intuition will tell you when something resonates.
